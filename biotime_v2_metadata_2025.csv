Forest cover in the 16-ha study area is heterogeneous withelements of northern hardwoods, white pine, red pine,and aspen sugar maple cover types (Eyre 1980). Clustersof Pinus resinosa and scattered individual Pinusstrobus amidst hardwoods date back over 250 yr basedon our tree ring counts and originated after fire (Frissell1973; Clark 1989). The understory is also heterogenous, with thickets of Corylus cornuta shrubs, clumpsof the shrub Acer spicatum, carpets of seedlings of Acer saccharum and Acer rubrum,  and patches of saplingsof Ostrya virginiana and Acer saccharum. The herbaceous flora is sparse and thus omitted from this analysis. Nomenclature follows Gleason and Cronquist 1991. Plots were sampled in mid-summer 1984, 1992, and1996. Each treefall had four 2 3 2 m plots: one plot near the base (0.5 m north of the stump s north edge), one plot in the fallen crown area (north of the bole just beyond the first branch of the fallen crown), and two control plots in parallel configuration at undamaged conspecific trees. Two base plots and three crown plotswere omitted due to interference from trails or treelesswet meadows. Note that plot locations were not permanently marked in the original survey. Thus, althoughthe treefall plots were likely to coincide in repeatedsampling, the control plots were less likely to be placed in exactly the same location in subsequent surveys. In each plot, all trees and shrubs were identified, counted, and recorded by height class (small. .50 cm in height;medium. 50-200 cm; tall. .200 cm in height. but dbh. 2.5 cm). Of 30 treefalls sampled originally in 1984, 17 were still distinguishable in 1992, and 11 were distinguishablein 1996. In some cases. we are certain that we found the location of the old treefall, but the primary windthrown tree had been obliterated by subsequent treefalls, or (particularly for Betula papyrifera )entirely decomposed. Windthrown pines were still visibleand were all relocated. In contrast, fallen Populustremuloides, P. grandidentata, and other hardwoodswere less persistent. Any resulting bias in plot retrieval should exaggerate the effects of windstorms, since larger treefalls were most likely to be included in the later surveys. To accommodate decreasing sample size overtime, comparisons are based on densities per unit area.The data set contained a total of 58 individual plots in1984 and 1992, and 40 plots in 1996. Sample size was sufficient to reveal significant changes over time in the statistical analysis; thus differences between treefalland control areas should also be detectable.

West Thornton. Grafton County. New Hampshire. USA. Our study took place on the 10-ha forest plot de- scribed by Holmes and Sturges (1975). which is located on a relatively steep (20-25%). south-southeast facing slope at an elevation of 500 to 600 m and adjacent to the lower third of watershed 6. the reference area for many of the Hubbard Brook ecosystem studies. The study plot was situated within a large tract of unfrag- mented and relatively homogeneous northern hard- woods forest. > 5 km distant from. and at an elevation 300 m above. the nearest human settlement. The only human-caused disturbances near the study area were on three experimental watersheds. 13. 10. and 22 ha in extent. which were logged by clear-cutting in 1967. in 1970. and from 1973 to 1975. respectively. The nearest of these was 0.6 km from the edge of our plot. the others were 1 and 2 km away. Although some for- est-dwelling birds moved to these areas in mid and late summer to feed on ripening fruit. we have no evidence that birds settling and breeding on the study area were in any way affected by these logged areas.Bird populations Bird censuses were conducted in a consistent manner in each of the 16 summers. These census methods have been described in detail by Holmes and Sturges (1975). Briefly. they involved: (1) Timed censuses. Two ob- servers moved at a rate of 50 m/6 min along parallel transect lines. 1 00 m apart. and recorded all birds heard or seen within 50 m on either side of the line. Since the 10-ha plot was 500 m long and 200 m wide and these lines ran 50 m in from the long sides. the entire plot was surveyed in a 1-h census. From these records. the numbers of individuals observed on the plot were then tallied. A minimum of two such censuses was conducted each week from late May through mid-July. (2) Territory-mapping. The positions of individual males (and females when seen). especially those en- gaged in simultaneous singing with neighbors. were plotted on a gridded census map. From these records. the territories of the males of many species could be delineated. (3) Mist-net captures. Forty to 50 mist nets. located at 50-m intervals on the census grid. were op- erated for 6-8 h/d. usually 1 or 2 d/wk from late May through early July in all years except 1980. Each cap- tured bird was given an aluminum band plus a unique combination of colored plastic bands. Capture and re- capture frequencies provided additional information on the presence of birds on the plot. including females and occasionally floaters. (4) Detailed observations. These provided information on nesting events and on the occurrence of females associated with males. Data from all methods were pooled and used to es- timate the total numbers of adult birds of each species living on the 1 0-ha study area during the breeding pe- riod. late May to early July. Final density estimates were adjusted for territories occurring only partly on the plot (i.e.. if a territory of a mated pair was half off the study area. only 0.5 male and 0.5 female for a total of one bird was counted) and for unmated males. The data therefore represent the total numbers of adult in- dividuals occupying 10 ha of northern hardwoods. For comparisons with most other studies. the numbers of individuals estimated to be on our plot should be di- vided in half to approximate the numbers of breeding pairs. These methods were most efficient for estimating the numbers of relatively small. mostly passerine birds that inhabit these forests. but also most woodpeckers and the one hummingbird species (see Table 2). We were unable to census adequately the raptors (Red-tailed Hawk. Buteo jamaicensis; Broad-winged Hawk. B. platypterus; Sharp-shinned Hawk. Accipiterstriatus; and Barred Owl. Strix varia). Ruffed Grouse (Bonasa um- bellus). Chimney Swift (Chaetura pelagica). and Pi- leated Woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus). which were present in this forest but ranged over an area much larger than our 10-ha plot. These low-density species are not included in our analyses. Insect Sampling We used two methods to estimate the abundance of larval Lepidoptera (caterpillars). First. during periods of relatively high caterpillar densities (specifically sum- mers 1969 through 1973). we collected their fecal pel- lets (frass) falling from the forest canopy. Following the procedures of Gosz et al. (1973). we placed 20 funnels (each 20 cm in diameter) lined with filter paper and attached to 1 m tall stakes in a rectangular array on the census plot. with adjacent funnels 100 m apart. Frass was collected from the funnels at 2-4 d intervals. dried at 70'C for 48 h. and then weighed. Second. in 10 summers. caterpillars were censused directly on foliage by visually searching at least 80 50- leaf samples (i.e.. 4000 leaves and supporting petioles and twigs) at z2-wk intervals. For this paper. only data from caterpillar counts on beech foliage in the forest understory are presented. because (1) it was cen- sused in more seasons than any other type of foliage. (2) caterpillar abundance there was representative of that occurring on the foliage of other forest trees (R. T. Holmes and J. C. Schultz. personal observation). and analyses of the vertical distribution of caterpillars in this forest showed few if any differences in their abundance among the canopy. subcanopy. and sapling strata (J. C. Schultz and R. T. Holmes. personal ob- servation). Foliage profile measurements For recording changes in the vertical distribution of foliage. we measured the foliage density profile. using the method of MacArthur and Horn (1969). Six sep- arate vertical transects were made along a randomly placed sample line at each of 20 sites located 100 m apart on the study area. The measurements were av- eraged for each site. and then means and standard de- viations of foliage densities at each of seven vertical strata were obtained for the plot as a whole. Data were taken on the plot in 1972-1973 and again in 1982 at the same locations. Student's t tests were used to detect differences in foliage density within each stratum be- tween sampling periods.

The abundances of all mobile taxa of fishes (Scarids. Labrids. Acanthurids. Serranids. etc.) observed on on a five by fifty meter transect which extends from the bottom to the surface of the water column are recorded by a diver using SCUBA. The diver then swims back along a one by fifty meter section of the original transect line and records the abundances of all non-mobile or cryptic taxa of fishes (Pomacentids. Gobiids. Cirrhitids. Holocentrids etc). Surveys are conducted between 0900 and 1600 hours (Moorea local time) during late July or early August each year. In 2006. divers also began to estimate the size (length) of each fish observed to the nearest half cm. Four replicate transects are surveyed in each of six locations on the forereef (two on each of Moorea's three sides). six locations on the backreef (two on each of Moorea's three sides) and on six locations on the fringing reef (two on each of Moorea's three sides) for a total of 72 individual transects. Transects are permanently marked using a series of small. stainless steel posts affixed to the reef. Transects on the forereef are located at a depth of approximately 15m. those on the backreef are located at a depth of approximately 1.5m and those on the fringing reef are located at a depth of approximately 10m.LocationsAnnual fish census locations are labeled with four components in a stratified design: 6 sites. 3 habitats. 4 transects. 2 swaths. (The swaths are the transect widths of 1 m and 5 m.) Therefore there are 144 unique locations surveyed each year. The six MCR-LTER sites span the three shores of the roughly triangular island of Moorea with Sites 1 and 2 on the north-facing shore. Sites 3 and 4 on the south-east-facing shore. and Sites 5 and 6 on the south-west-facing shore. At each site. the three habitats are the Fringing Reef. Backreef. and Forereef. At each habitat. there are four transects. Each transect has two swaths. The two swaths are described in the Diver Observation method step.Dive ConditionsIn addition to the biotic data collected. divers also record data on the date and time each transect was surveyed. wind speed and sea state. swell height in m. amount of cloud cover in % and horizontal visibility in m. Dive conditions are recorded for each dive. which is unique to a habitat at a site for a year. Therefore there are 18 unique dive conditions each year (3 habitats at 6 sites).DiversAt each site. at each habitat. there are four transects. each covered by an assigned diver (in 2005 by 2 divers). Whenever possible. the same diver covers the same transect number every year. (Transect 3 has varied.) The diver is listed by their initials. (In 2005. the initials of 2 divers are concatenated.) The diver ID is determined by the year and transect number; there are 4 unique diver IDs for each year.Reference for fish census protocolThe MCR-LTER annual fish census is based on the 'Fish Belt Transect' method described in: 'Methods for Ecological Monitoring Of Coral Reefs: A Resource For Managers.

Lockley. He took a lease on the island in October1927. and kept records of breeding birds from 1928 to1940 (Lockley 1938. 1947). After the war theobservatory was run by the West Wales Field Societyand the Council for the Promotion of Field Studies (nowthe Field Studies Council). and later by the EdwardGrey Institute of Field Ornithology of the University ofOxford. Records of breeding and. for most species inmost years. counts or estimates of the numbers ofbreeding pairs are available from 1928 to 1979. with abreak from 1941 to 1945. making 47 years of records.Those up to 1967 have been published by Lack (1969)and analysed by Williamson (1981). Those since 1967have been extracted from the Annual Reports of theObservatory in the Alexander Library of the EdwardGrey Institute. The whole record for land and waterbirds is given in Tab. 1.The criterion for inclusion in Tab. 1 is breeding. butas is now well recognised. there are different degrees ofcertainty in such records. For a study of immigrationand extinction the important question is whether a pairof birds was attempting to breed. rather than whether itbred successfully. For instance the raven Corvus coraxhad one pair every year (two in 1961). but in 1978built a nest in Steep Bay. but it remained empty. Inthe British Trust for Ornithology code this is B. Nestbuilding. and counts only as Probable breeding in thisspecies. though it is regarded as Confirmed breedingin most others (Sharrock 1976). For this study it countsas a population of one pair. In most cases the annualreport gives a single figure for the number of pairs. Forneighbouring integers. e.g. 12 or 13. I have taken thehigher figure. for ranges. e.g. 35 to 40. a figure at or just slightly from Lack (1969). and includes figures thatabove the mid-point (38 in this case). Lack records as question marks. and Lockley also givesFor the pre-war figures Lockley (1947) differs the figures for 1940. I have therefore taken histhroughout. rather than Lack's. The only importantdifference in relation to the MacArthur-Wilson theoryis that Lockley records one pair of sky lark Alauda arvensisin 1938. which Lack (and Williamson 1981) recordas an extinction followed by an immigration in1939. Lockley also notes that he shot or deported littleowls Athene noctua when he could. because they atestorm petrels Hydrobates pelagicus. so I have excludedlittle owls from Tab. 1.It is evident that many of the estimates of the commonbirds in Tab. 1 are round figures. In some yearsestimates are lacking. though breeding is recorded. andas a full set of figures is needed for the calculations thatfollow I have interpolated. approximately linearly. insuch cases. The interpolated figures are in italics in Tab.1.Skokholm is a most important station for sea-birdpopulations. Throughout the years there have beenthousands of pairs of Manx shearwater Puffinus puffinus.storm petrel Hydrobates pelagicus. and puffinsFratercula arctica. and these are the largest colonies.along with those on the neighbouring island of Skomer.in the Celtic Sea (Cramp et al. 1974). Herring gullsLarus argentatus and lesser black-backed gulls Larusfuscus have increased from hundreds of pairs pre-war tothousands now. There are also hundreds of pairs ofrazorbills Alca torda and guillemots Uria aalge. Thegreat black-backed gull Larus marinus population iscontrolled at around ten pairs. The fulmar Fulmarusglacialis first bred in 1967 and even now occupies lessthan twenty sites. There have been casual records ofbreeding of shag Phalacrocorax aristotelis and kittiwakeRissa tridactyla (Lockley 1969). There have also beenthirty to forty pairs of rock pipits Anthus spinolettabreeding on the cliffs each year. Lack (1969) did notregard them as land-birds. and I have. somewhat reluctantly.followed him. partly because the estimates ofpopulation size are even rougher than those of themeadow pipit A. pratensis.MethodsMany features of the data can be brought out by simplemethods (Williamson 1981). However. to produce asatisfactory ordination of both species and years is notso simple. and requires a consideration both of differentordination methods. and of whether the data should betransformed.For most biological populations a transformation tothe logarithm of the numbers is desirable (Williamson1972a). When there are many zeros. as in Tab. 1. log(n+1) or better the arc-sinh transformation. which islog (n+(n2+ 1)12). can be used (Williamson 1981). butthese small numbers show features of a Poisson distribution.s o a square root transformation may be desirable(Pollard 1977). Tukey (1977) gives methods fordetermining an appropriate power transformation.which he refers to as re-expression. (with the logarithmbeing equivalent to a zero power). It is well-known thata plot of the logarithm of the mean against thelogarithm of the variance may indicate that a transformation is needed. When the variance is proportional tothe mean. a square root transformation is indicated; thestandard deviation proportional to the mean indicates alogarithmic transformation. Taylor et al. (1978) givemany examples of such plots showing clearly. to mymind. that most biological data needs transformationand usually something. on Tukey's scale. bounded bythe square root and the logarithm.These tests on the data of years in Tab. 1. both includingand excluding zeros. point to a square roottransformation. By species. again with and withoutzeros. the results are more variable. which is not surprising.The raven population is almost constant at onepair. The stock dove Columba oenas and jackdaw Corvusmonedula populations vary from zero to sixty pairs.In view of this scatter.although a logarithmic transformationwould be better for the common species. asquare root transformation is justifiable for all. and sohas been used.A standard Principal Component Analysis of datawith many zeros usually produces a curved result. thehorseshoe effect. from artificial data designed to belinear (Williamson 1978). Various methods have beenproposed to prevent this including multi-dimensionalscaling. MDS (Carroll and Arabie 1980). reciprocal averaging(or contingency analysis). and Hill's developmentof it. Decorana (Gauch 1982). and the step-acrossmethod (Williamson 1978). Reciprocal averaging andstep-across are direct; multi-dimensional scaling isiterative. and requires a variety of starting configurations.Decorana assumes the second Principal axis to bean artefact. and reduces it by a slicing technique.Step-across applies only to incidence matrices. whereall the entries are one of zero. Much of the variation inTab. 1 and similar data occurs in the number of entitiespresent. The similarity index used in step-across is theJaccard one. the number of joint occurrences. Thenatural extension of this to continuous data is illustratedin Fig. 2. It is the total set of joint occurrences. the areaof the intersection of the species graphs. Mathematically.this is Kendall's (1971) circle product. I min (a.b). The effect of using the circle product on species withmoderate overlap is to make them more similar than ifthe Jaccard index is used. so tending to re-create ahorseshoe. This can be corrected by a transformation;the square root of the circle product has been used here.This development of step-across can be called stepalongfor convenience.English (1982) compared MDS. Decorana andstep-along analyses of both the Eastern Wood (Williamson1981) data and a sub-set of the Skokholm data.using years in which complete records exist. Not allvariants of MDS are available at York. but he foundthose that were very expensive in computer time. requiring arbitrary choices of starting point. and the resultsdisappointing. Decorana produced the straightesttime axis. but. as will be seen. the time axis at Skokholmshould be curved. So the method has had the unfortunateeffect of removing. as an artefact. a real feature.The species ordination by Decorana was not readily interpretable.Consequently. the remainder of this paperdeals only with step-along results.

In 1952 inmixed prairie near Redvers. Saskatchewan. and in 1953in aspen-parkland near Lousana. Alberta (Fig. 1). theUnited States Fish and Wildlife Service undertookyearly collections of waterfowl census and habitat dataon 0.2 km wide. permanently established transects. TheRedvers Waterfowl Study Area was a reversed-L transect.each arm roughly 32.2 km long; the total areawas 12.9 km2. The terrain was gently rolling and reliefgenerally <3 m. The pothole basins were generallysaucer shaped rather than bowl shaped (Stoudt 1971).The Lousana Waterfowl Study Area was a rectangulartransect roughly 16.1 x 6.4 km. or 9.3 km2. The terrainwas knob-and-kettle-like. A larger percentage ofponds at Lousana. compared with Redvers (45 vs.31%). were classified as permanent (Smith 1971).Each pothole on the transects was numbered andvisited several times yearly when breeding pairs of allspecies were counted. Dzubin (1969a) provided a reviewof the potential biases in transect-collected censusdata for ducks. Violations of these assumptionspose problems for deterministic calculations; the valuein these data is that. while they may be crude by thosestandards. the amount of data and the time span theycover outweigh disadvantages imposed by the mannerof data collection. Two assumptions. for purposes ofthis analysis. are important: first. the relative populationsizes of ducks were as the observers recordedthem. and second. proportional use of different pondtypes by different species was represented by the censusdata. The second assumption is made more plausibleby validation of the first; the first is reasonablebecause considerable effort was made to census allponds thoroughly (Smith 1971:14. Stoudt 1971:14). Onebiologist collected most of the data. although in recentyears. other United States Fish and Wildlife Servicepersonnel and I collected data.Each pothole was scored for each of the followingcharacteristics: permanence classification. size.depth. degree of openness of surrounding vegetation.percent coverage of pond surface by emergentvegetation. and type of vegetation. All values of habitatvariables were of ordinal level; type of vegetationwas not a nominal-level variable because it tookon values that corresponded to structural complexity(height. density) of each plant type or association.Twenty-six years of data (1952-1977) from Redverswere available for analysis. Four censuses were conductedyearly from 1952 to 1965; commencement datesof censuses varied between 1-11 May. 1-4 June. 29June-13 July. and 22-26 July. Eight and six censuseswere conducted in the drought years 1961 and 1962.respectively. After 1965. one July census was begunbetween 11 and 23 July; dates of May and June censusesvaried as in previous years. Nine years (1968-1976) of data from the Lousana area were availablefor analysis.

The method makes useof concepts from distance sampling. i.e.. point countsor line-intercept techniques. The method makes noattempts to model capture-history data. therefore it wasnot necessary to follow individuals through time(between sessions). Distance sampling methods allow forsighting or detection (capture) probabilities todecrease with increasing distance from the point orline. The modeling of detection probability as afunction of distance forms the basis for estimation.Trapping webs were designed to provide a gradient ofcapture probabilities. decreasing with distance from theweb center. Density estimation from the trapping web wasbased on three assumptions:1. All animals located at the center of the webwere caught with probability 1.0;2. Individuals did not move preferentially towardor away from the web center;3. Distances from the web center to each trapstation were measured accurately.Each web consisted of 12 trap lines radiating around acenter station. each line with 12 permanently-markedtrap stations. In order to increase the odds ofcapturing any animals inhabiting the center of a web.the center station had four traps. each pointing in acardinal direction. and the first four stations of eachtrap line were spaced only 5 m apart. providing a trapsaturation effect. The remaining eight stations in atrap line were spaced at 10 m intervals. The web thusestablished a series of concentric rings of traps. Trapsin the ring nearest the web center are close together.while the distances separating traps that form aparticular ring increase with increasing distance of thering from the web center. The idea is that the webconfiguration produces a gradient in trap density and.therefore. in the probability of capture. Three randomlydistributed trapping webs were constructed at each site.The perimeters of webs were placed at least 100 m apartin order to minimize homerange overlap for individualscaptured in the outer portion of neighboring webs.Measurement TechniquesEach site containing three webs was sampled for threeconsecutive nights during spring (in mid May or earlyJune) and summer (in mid July or early August for years1989 to 1993. then mid September to early October foryears 1994 through 2000). In that rodent populationswere not sampled monthly over the study period. there isno certainly that either spring or summer trapping timesactually captured annual population highs or lows. Basedon reproductive data in the literature. an assumptionwas made that sampling times chosen represent periods ofthe year when rodents have undergone. and wouldregister. significant seasonal change in density.During each trapping session. one Sherman live trap(model XLF15 or SFAL. H. B. Sherman Traps. Tallahassee.FL) was placed. baited with rolled oats. and set at eachpermanent. numbered station (four in the center) on eachweb. for a total 444 traps over three webs. Traps werechecked at dawn each day. closed during the day. andreset just before dusk. Habitat. trap station number.species. sex. age (adult or juvenile). mass. bodymeasurements (total length. tail length. hind footlength. ear length). and reproductive condition (males:scrotal or non-scrotal; females: lactating. vaginal orpregnant) were recorded for each initial capture of anindividual. Each animal was marked on the belly with apermanent ink felt pen in order to distinguish it fromother individuals during the same trapping session. Thetrap station number for an initial capture related to aparticular trapping ring on a web and. therefore. to aparticular distance from the center of the web. The areasampled by a ring of traps was computed based oncircular zones whose limits are defined by pointshalfway between adjacent traps along trap lines; anadditional 25 m radius was added to the outer ring oftraps in order to account for homerange size ofindividuals caught on the outer ring.Analytical ProceduresArea trapped and number of individuals caught for eachring of traps was the basis for estimating theprobability density function of the area sampled. Theprogram DISTANCE produced the estimators used tocalculate density. Where sample size for a particularspecies and web was less than an arbitrarily chosenn=10. the number of individuals captured during thatsession was simply divided into the area of the web plusthe additional 25 m radius (4.9087 ha).

Site descriptionWithin the 20 ha study area there are 24 experimental plots. Each plot has anarea of 0.25 ha and is fenced to regulate rodent access to the plot. Access is regulated using gatescut into the fencing. Large gates (3.7 ? 5.7 cm) allow all small mammals to access plots. Smallgates (1.9 ? 1.9 cm) exclude kangaroo rats (Dipodomys) whose inflated auditory bullae make theirskulls too large to pass through the gates. Rodent removal plots do not contain any gates andanimals caught on those plots are removed and released outside the cattle exclosure fence.On each plot there are 49 permanent trapping stations marked by rebar stakes forming a 7 ? 7 grid.Every stake on a plot has a unique identifying number denoting the coordinate of that stake on thatplot. For example. stake 11 is the first stake on the first row. Rows are numbered 1 through 7going from the most northern row to the most southern. Columns are numbered 1 through 7 goingfrom the most western column to the most eastern (See metadata.htm. Fig. 1).Treatments: See metadata.htm. Table 1. for details on treatment assignments for each plot.Data Collection Period. Frequency: From 1977?2002. plots were trapped around each newmoon ? which occurs approximately once a month. though occasionally blue moons do occur.resulting in 2 separate surveys in a month. Occasionally. months are missed. Months that areentirely missed are not noted in the database. Sometimes weather or other unforeseen occurrencesprevent the complete trapping of a survey. these are noted in the database (see Table 1 below).3. Research MethodsField: The site is surveyed for rodents approximately once each month. The survey occurs asclose to the new moon as possible to minimize external effects on trapping success which could bemisconstrued as actual changes in populations. During a survey. each plot is trapped for one nightwith treatments divided evenly between nights to eliminate differences between controls andtreatments caused by environmental differences on different nights. When a plot is surveyed. allgates are closed to ensure that only resident individuals are captured. At each stake. one Shermanlive-trap is placed and baited with millet seed. Traps are collected the next morning andindividuals processed. Each individual was tagged and data on species. location caught (plot andstake). sex. reproductive condition. weight. and hindfoot length were recorded. Until 1993.individuals were tagged using either ear tags or toe tags. After 1993. individuals werepredominately tagged using Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) Tags. Use of PIT tags wasE090-118-D1-Rodent metadata http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E090/118/Portal_rodent_meta...halted from 1997?2000 while we waited for a patent infringement lawsuit to be resolved againstthe company that supplied our tags and scanning system (Troyvan). In 2000 we resumed using PITtags. using a different system (Biomark). It is noted in the database if either an animal escapedbefore all information was gathered. was removed from the site because it was caught on a plot itwas supposed to be excluded from. or died during trapping.Most data has been consistently collected over the timespan of the study. The one exception is thatinitially data were also collected on the location of the burrow for Dipodomys spectabilis andNeotoma albigula. This was discontinued after 1994.Taxonomy and systematics: Taxonomy and identification of species is consistent with Mammalsof Arizona by Hoffmeister (1986). with the exception that some species identified as Perognathusin Hoffmeister (1986) are now a separate genus (Chaetodipus).

For the presentation and thepreprocessing of the species data. logarithmic values of the carbon content ofeach species population per sampling date were calculated and plottedsymmetrically as kite diagrams along the horizontal (time) axis (Figures 4 and 5).Kite diagrams. first constructed by Lohmann (1908). are still considered topresent adequately phytoplankton species assemblages and succession (cf. Reidet al.. 1985). In these diagrams time is the horizontal axis. Species are arrangedvertically in a sequence that approximates their seasonal succession. Thissequence was derived from the divisive hierarchical clustering method TWINSPAN(Hill. 1979a). which performs a simultaneous ordering of samples and species.A number of diatoms and flagellates was not identified to species level anddiffered in dimensions.

Asynthesis of the anchovy spawning areas. larvae and juvenile distribution. and hypothesesabout recruitment mechanisms can be found in Irigoien et al (2007). Stations were locatedevery 3 nautical miles (nm) along transects 15 nm apart perpendicular to the coast. Avertical plankton haul was made at each sampling station. using a 150?m PairoVET net (2-CalVET nets. Smith et al.. 1985). The net was lowered to a maximum depth of 100 m or 5m above the bottom at shallower stations. Samples were preserved in 4% formaldehydebuffered with sodium tetraborate. Samples were stored in 150 ml jars. The sample wasthoroughly mixed in a measuring cylinder. the total volume measured (usually around 150ml) and an aliquot of 6 ml was taken with a pipette from each sample. The average numberof organisms counted in each plate with this sub sampling set up is around 400 individuals.The aliquot was stained for 24 hours with 4 ml 1% eosin. which stains the cell cytoplasmand the muscle protein. This stain creates sufficient contrast to be recognised by imageanalysis and reduces counting of detrital material. The sub-samples were scanned onpolystyrene plates (12.7 x 8.5 cm) in 24 bit colour. at a resolution of 600 dpi using an HPScanjet8200 series scanner (reflective). The samples were not manually separated.Preliminary work (unpublished) has shown that as long as the percentage of the imagecovered by the sample remains below 3 % there is a linear relation between the number ofitems and the automatic counting. Over that threshold the percentage of organisms touchingeach other increases and results in an underestimation of the abundance. For samples fromthe Bay of Biscay the aliquot taken and the plastic plate size assures that this limit is notreached. These images were analyzed using Zooimage (www.sciviews.org/zooimage). Atotal of 17 classes were selected combining expert opinion and the class selection methodproposed by Fernandes et al. (2008).

In 1975 a Wildco Petersen grab was used to sample stations 75-569 to 75-575 from Pandom II. These samples were taken by a party from Northern Operations . Department of Fisheries and Environment at Whitehorse. Yukon Territory.The Wildco Petersen grab samples an area of 0.09 m2 and has a volumeof about 9.7 liters. The area sampled by grab at each station varied from 0.25 to 0.32m2, which produced comparable assemblages. Only adequate grab samples were retained. An adequate sampleis one in which the grab samples the bottom evenly. samples atleast 2 liters of substrate. and is closed when brought to the surface.Depth of penetratlon into the substrate may vary with type of substrate.but at most stations depth of penetration was from 6 to 10 cm.After the collection of a set of grabs from a station. substrateand organisms were washed on a stainless steel screen with a mesh sizeof 0.5 mm. Retained invertebrates and debris were preserved in formalin(1 part formaldehyde with 9 parts water) for transporting to the ArcticBiological Station where they were processed. Processing consists of sorting, identifying, counting and weighing specimens in each sample. Each sample was sorted by hand using a Wild M5 dissecting microscope. Specimens were identified to species in most cases andcounts of specimens for each species were recorded. Species identification was not attempted for a few taxa, such as nematodes, nemerteans, hydroids, and bryozoans, and although several species maybe involved, they were listed by taxon on a collective basis. In a similar manner sponges, bryozoans, hydroids, and other colonial forms were regarded as one individual . Protozoans were arbitrarily excludedfrom the study .After sorting and identification specimens were dried (drying oven at 100C overnight) and weighed on a Sartorius gravimetric balance to four decimal places. The dry weight excludes tubes and shells, but no effort was made to eliminate gut contents. The calcareous parts of echinoderms and the skeletal parts of sponges are included in the dry weight because of difficulty in separating organic and inorganic parts.Data are presented on a m2 basis (Tables 8-108). For each sample number and weight of individuals of each species were multiplied by a factor t o convert sample values to m2 values. As an example, values derived from a sample area of 0.25 m2 were multiplied by 4 to obtain the m2 values. The factor was rounded off to the nearest 0.5; thus, afactor of 2.5 (instead of 2.6) was used to multiply values from a samplewith an area of 0-39 m2 in converting t o m2 values. Most species collectedby grab were considered to be representative. and their sample values wereconverted to m2 equivalents in a consistent manner. In a few cases, as indicated, the sample values were used without converting, because representation of occasionally collected, usually large, epifaunal species could not be assessed.",Wildco Petersen grabs,280,Script: study98-280_split_VB.R.

SUMMARY FROM SOURCE: The data were collected from research cruises and resupply vessels in the southern Indian Ocean. The majority of the records were collected between October and March. The technique used for collection is that prescribed by the Biological Investigation of Marine Antarctic Systems and Stocks (BIOMASS) Working Party on Bird Ecology. Meteorological and oceanographic data were also collected concurrently.
DESCRIPTION FROM AUTHORS: Seabird observations and related environmental data from ships either performing marine science work or taking personnel and cargo to various Antarctic stations. Incidental observations of whales and seals are also noted. Observations are typically made from the bridge out one side of the ship. All observations since the 1980s have been using same protocols - sunrise to sunset. Early projects used hourly snapshots (15 minutes observations) with remainder of hour recording observations as non-snapshot obs. More recent projects use continuous observations that allow to slice the continuous data into bins that match the early protocol.",Standardised seabird & mammal observations made from sunrise to sunset in different cruise ships.,NA,"This study was re-curated for version 2 of the database. RECORD REMOVALS: Removed null observation - no birds seen, Suspect observation, removed unconfirmed observations, removed observations with no species type and no taxon information in general, removed observations with no coordinates, date of sampling, or observation code information. Furthermore, removed voyage id = 89, because observations on the same area span one year only (i.e., not suitable for BioTIME, which requires at least two years of data for roughly the same area). Kept info on depth when available (multiplied by -1 as it is below water). IMPORTANT NOTE ON DEPTH: Depth is a correlate, not a determinate of seabirds at sea. As many oceanic seabirds forage well away from breeding colonies, the depth range of their foraging areas will range from 0m to the maximum depth of the ocean basin over which the birds are  flying. This maximum depth represents the value in the column “DEPTH”. TAXONOMY: Included six taxa that were not in v1: Diomedea royal albatross sp, Eudyptes chrysolophus, Eudyptes sclateri, Eudyptes pachyrhynchus, Eudyptes robustus, Eudyptula minor. Diomedea royal albatross sp is now Diomedea sp in the database. All observations at different distances from the ship (near, medium, far & unreported) were pooled for any give date & voyage, since all birds were consistently recorded at all distances when seen. All observation codes were pooled (where the forward quadrant = husky observations) after consulting the author. SAMPLE_DESC: Year_Month_Day_VoyageID_Latitude_Longitude.

The MNCR was initiated to provide a comprehensive baseline of information on marine habitats and their associated species around the coast of Britain which would aid coastal zone and sea-use management and to contribute to the identification of areas of marine natural heritage importance. The focus of MNCR work was on benthic habitats (often referred to as biotopes) in intertidal and inshore (typically within 3nm) subtidal areas.The majority of data were collected using methods described in the MNCR Rationale and Methods report (Hiscock 1996). Broadly. this encompassed surveying a range of sites within a geographical area to sample and describe the variety of habitats present (sampling habitats in different substrata. depths. wave exposures. current regimes. salinity regimes and so on). Each habitat was sampled using semi-quantitative recording techniques (SACFOR abundance scales) for recording epibiota on rocky habitats.

The summer RV survey follows a stratified random sampling design (Halliday and Kohler 1971). and includes both hydrographic sampling and sampling of fish and invertebrates using a bottom otter trawl.The bottom trawl survey was originally planned to provide biomass and abundance trends for groundfish residing at depths from about 50 m to 400 m. and was extended to cover depths down to 750 m in 1999.There were changes to the net used and the vessel conducting the survey in 1982 and 1983. From 1970 ? 1981 the RV A.T. Cameron. a side-trawler using the Yankee 36 trawl. was used for the survey. In 1982. the RV Lady Hammond was used. towing a Western IIA trawl. Since 1983. the Alfred Needler has been the primary survey vessel. and the Western IIA trawl has been used in all years. Conversion factors were calculated for net and vessel changes (Fanning 1985).For long-term averages. the most appropriate starting point has been selected for each species. In the case of white hake. biomass plots start in 1970 but the abundance index data only go back to 1982. For silver hake. biomass plots and abundance index data are used starting in 1982. This is in conjunction with the change in the type of trawl. from a Yankee 36 to a Western IIA. as well as more consistent identification of white hake and red hake.In 2010. additional survey tows were completed in deeper water off the shelf edge (750 ? 1.800 m) to investigate species composition and biomass in deeper waters. Catches from these stations are not included in the biomass index estimates. to ensure that comparability with other years is maintained. Distribution plots are included here only for the most abundant species noted at these depths. Tables of the entire catches at these depths are also presented.The survey area has been divided into three zones. based on oceanography and biogeography. Trends are shown for the entire shelf survey area. and also for three separate regions: eastern Scotian Shelf (4VW; strata 440 - 466). western Scotian Shelf (4X East; strata 470 - 481). and Gulf of Maine/Bay of Fundy (4X West; strata 482 - 495). Differences in patterns of fish abundance and species composition are apparent for these regions during the survey. Strata 496 - 498 (the shelf edge; 350 m ? 750 m) have been sampled in most years since 1996. while strata 501 - 505 (750 m ? 1.800 m) have not previously been sampled as part of the stratified random survey series. These depths are considered separate biogeographic zones and since they have not been sampled in all years. are not included in the long-term biomass index estimates.Plots of the size and distribution of catches are provided for selected species and stratified average catches are compared with past results to provide a general overview of trends in abundance and biomass. For select commercial species where individual fish weights have been collected throughout most of the time series. trends in condition (Fulton?s K: weight/length3) are also included (Ricker 1975).Data are presented for the major commercial species. for species that comprise a large part of the survey catch. and for species where the 2010 catch was either unusually high or low (see also DFO 2011a). The set of species examined to determine if catches in 2010 were unusual was restricted to those where the area occupied exceeded 7.000 square nautical miles (approximately 1/7th of the surveyed area) in 2010. or averaged greater 2 than this in the 1970s. the 1980s or the 1990s. The species examined were restricted in this manner to avoid rare species for which catches display high inter-annual variability.Comparisons of stratified length frequencies for 2009 and 2010 to the long-term mean are also included for major commercial fish species. These data were summarized to assist in reviewing trends in abundance that are directly relevant to fisheries management when they are developing advice on allowable catch; hence. these data are grouped by the applicable stock management areas for each species.

Working at depths of 3 to 16 m with teams using other existing rapid assessment methods. a method for algal assessment is needed that will minimize the time in the water yet yield the greatest amount of data possible. A high-resolution digital camera mounted on a 0.18 m? photo quadrat frame (Fig.1) with an Ikelite Substrobe digital slave strobe has been built to quantitatively assess marine algae.In addition to photographs. data from each quadrat are recorded on a waterproof data sheet that includes space for recording the species found in the quadrat. a ?map? area for identifying cryptic species in depressions that may prove difficult in computer analysis. and codes for the most common genera and species of macroalgae. corals. invertebrates. and substrate types to standardize and shorten note taking.Two trained observers move along the transect together with one observer placing the framer and operating the camera and the other taking notes.

Photographs are taken at predetermined random points.After a photograph is taken by the first diver. the second diver identifies algae within the photoquadrat. records the relative abundance of the 5 most abundant algae on a scale of 1 ? 5 (with 1 being most abundant). draws a quadrat map locating species that may be hard to identify in a photograph. and collects representative samples of the algal species in the quadrats for later identification in the laboratory.Once data are recorded. the photoquadrat is moved to the next random point and the procedure repeated. To prevent redundancy. only samples of new algal species found in subsequent quadrats are collected.

NOAA-certified CRED divers conduct towed diver surveys as a method of assessing relatively large areas of reef habitat. This method involves towing two divers behind a small surface craft that is moving at a velocity of 1-2 mph. Although the driver of the surface craft attempts to follow a depth contour. the divers also actively maneuver the ?towboards? they are holding onto so as to maintain a relatively constant elevation above the surface of the reef.    One of the two towboards is equipped with a digital videocamera that is pointing in the forward-looking direction so as to document both the ?rugosity ?. or 3-dimensional topography. of the reef. as well as the fish associated with the reef. The other towboard is equipped with a digital videocamera that is pointing in the downward-looking direction. so as to record the benthos over which the diver and camera are moving.    Divers maneuvering the towboards on which the cameras are mounted record selected data pertaining to fish and to habitat. using datasheets mounted on the towboards. These in-situ observations are used to assist with preliminary summaries of the fish communities and the reef habitat. and as a general reference during more detailed. computer-assisted analyses.    Both towboards are equipped with a SEABIRD sensor that records depth and water temperature every 5 seconds. so that biotic observations can be linked to salient physical parameters.    A GPS unit on the surface tow vessel records the trackline over which the divers. and recording cameras. are being towed. so that the results that are later generated by analysis of the digital videos can be linked to geographic position.    A complete towboard survey is 50 minutes in length. and covers close to 2 miles of reef.Analysis of Towboard Benthic VideotapesUsing computer-assisted technology. the images captured by the downward-pointed camera of the benthic habitat are quantified as percent cover of the principle components that can be recognized from the videotapes. These components include: live coral. unencrusted (recently dead) coral. macroalgae. turf algae. coralline algae. other invertebrates. sand. rock. pavement. and rubble.The suite of corals that can be identified from the videotapes depends upon the assemblage of corals present in the area being surveyed (e.g.. the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands are less speciose than the U.S. Line & Phoenix Islands). and in general is limited to the genus level of identification. Similarly. algae can typically be identified from the videotapes only according to their functional class (macro. turf. coralline).Thus. while towed diver surveys are capable of assessing large areas of reef. it requires more stationary divers working at smaller spatial scales during REA surveys to achieve a higher degree of taxonomic resolution.

These video sequences enable later. computer-assisted quantitative analyses of percent coverage of corals. algae. and substrate types. Additionally. at the beginning of each of the transect lines. a 360? pan of the surrounding reef area is slowly videotaped to document the topography and general nature of the surrounding area.The coral biologist then swims back along as many of the transect lines as bottom time permits and lists coral species occurring within 0.5 m? of each side of the transect lines and the size class to which the maximum diameter of the colony belongs ( 5 cm; 5?10 cm; 10-20 cm; 20-40cm; 40-80 cm; 80-160 cm; or 160 cm). In geographic regions such as the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands where coral richness and abundance are reduced relative to lower latitude regions with higher species richness. the protocol is amended to include all corals occurring within 1m of each side of the transect lines.A random swim is then conducted in the vicinity of the transect lines within an area of about 5.000m2 in which all coral species are listed and assigned a DACOR abundance code based on visual estimation (dominant. abundant. common. occasional. and rare).

Tows approximately 1 NM long are proposed in each grid and plotted in PSeaWindplotTM (using charts of the NAD 1983 datum). From prior experience and localknowledge. some grids are classified as untowable during the plotting process. Due tothe large amount of fixed gear and the appeal to fishermen to cooperate with the surveyby clearing the tows. identifying good tow locations is a priority. If no towable bottomcan be found within a 2-mile radius. a new random number is chosen within the samestratum. Beginning and end points of each tow are identified in P-Sea Windplot. To theextent possible. for ease of identification by lobster industry members. tows follow loranlines. Loran C coordinates are converted to latitude/longitude degrees to the nearest0.001 decimal minutes.2SELECTION OF FIXED STATIONSAfter the initial survey in the fall of 2000. two stations per stratum were designated asfixed stations to be sampled on each subsequent survey. In areas where previous workhad been done. the stations were selected due to their historical importance3. In areas withno history. one station was selected as being roughly representative of the average catchfor its respective stratum and the other was randomly selected. After the addition of thefourth stratum in the spring of 2003. fixed stations were designated for that stratum usingthe same criteria.FISHING GEARTrawl design considerations for the survey include effectiveness of the gear forsampling the complex bottom in the nearshore areas of the Gulf of Maine andcomparability with previous and ongoing surveys by NMFS and MassachusettsDivision of Marine Fisheries. The net is a modified version of the shrimp netdesign used in Maine waters (Appendix A). designed to fish for a variety of nearbottomdwelling species without targeting any specific component. RobertTetrault. the vessels? owner. and net designer Jeff Flagg designed the net to fishfeet in length with nominal horsepower. Three identical nets were constructed forthis survey in the event of tearing or loss. Net tapers were cut to permit the shapeof the net to get maximum height while allowing the net to remain tight on thebottom. The net is shackled from the footrope to the frame with two 3/8th inchshackles to a banded wire that runs parallel with the footrope. Heavy rubber wingbobbins retard bottom wing lift at the net end of the bottom leg. Top legs are7/16th wire. 60 feet in length with soft eyes at each end. and bottom legs are 5/8thinch wire. 58 feet in length with two feet of 5/8th inch chain at the end where theleg attaches to the bottom wing for a total of 60 feet. Bottom legs are coveredwith 2 -3/8? cookies to prevent them from digging into the mud. The net isconstructed of 2-inch #24 polyethylene mesh. with a 1-inch (stretched measure)mesh liner in the cod end. Otter boards are #7.5 Bisons. Attached to the 70-foot.5/8th inch Rander?s Combination Wire Rope footrope is a roller frame strung onto?? IPS of 6x19 construction with a fiber core. The ten-foot wide bosom section ismade up of eight-inch rubber discs on six-inch centers along with eight evenlyspaced toggles. Spacing is maintained by smaller four-inch cookies strungbetween the discs. The two 29-foot wing sections are made up of six-inch rubberdiscs spaced 4 ? inches apart. with the same four inch cookies used to maintainspacing. Each wing section contains twelve toggles spaced evenly to facilitatefootrope attachment. The 5/8? Rander?s combination rope headrope has twentyeight8? center-hole. deep-sea net floats strung with 5/8? yellow polyethylenefloat line. Between surveys. the net is sent back to the manufacturer where it isreturned to specification (Appendix B). Nets will be replaced as they age to keepthe gear in good working condition and insure consistency.

(I) The beam trawl. ofwhich descriptions and figures may be found in several previous reports of the UnitedStates Fish Commission (Verrill. 1883; Tanner. 1884. 1897). The trawls employed inthe present work were quite diminutive in comparison with those used in commercialtrawling. having a beam length (width of aperture) of from 6 to 9 feet. and a depth ofnet not much exceeding 10 feet. This appliance can be employed to best advantage ona level bottom of hard sand or fine gravel. upon which the lead line fits closely. It iswell adapted to scraping 'up the larger mollusks. fishes. crustacea. echinoderms. algre.etc.. which lie upon the surface. but not to penetrating the sand or gravel; and it consequentlyfails to disturb those forms which burrow in even a slight degree. For thisreason. and because of the large size of its meshes. the beam trawl was commonly notemployed alone; but a dredge of the next type was ordinarily appended to the lowerend of the bag. '(2) The ordinary naturalists' dredge. of the type originally devised by O. F. Muller(see Verrill. 1883; Tanner. 1884. 1897; Agassiz. 1888). This. as is well known. consistsof a heavy. rectangular. iron frame. to which is fitted the mouth of a bag of stoutnetting. In the commoner pattern the two longer sides of the frame consist of sharp.outwardly flaring edges. adapted to cutting into the sand. gravel. or mud; and thedredge is practically certain to drag in such a way that one or the other of these edges islowermost.A modification of this type of dredge which was freely used during the present workwas the rake dredge. which differs from the ordinary pattern in possessing heavy teethalong the cutting edge. The frame. in both types. is fitted with two heavy movableiron arms. to which the dredge line is attached. Commonly acomparatively light ropewas fastened to one of these hahdles. so that in case an obstruction was encounteredthis line might part and allow the dredge frame to free itself without escaping altogether.The dredge net was protected from tearing by a sheathing of heavy canvas. which wasattached to the frame outside of the net and formed a bag. open at the lower end. Thenetting commonly employed in these dredges had a t-inch or a r-inch mesh a in theupper portion. while the lower end was quite closely woven. Such meshes were likelyto retain not only the stones. shells. and the great majority of living organisms. buteven considerable quantities of the bottom material. Fine loose sand. however. and inless degree mud. were likely to be washed out almost completely during the reeling inof the dredge line. Where such bottoms were encountered the canvas sheathing of thedredge was frequently tied up at the lower end. or sometimes a simple canvas bag alone(mud bag) was attached to the frame. During the last season of the regular dredgingwork (1905) the mud bag was nearly always employed in connection with the beamtrawl. It is obvious that a much fairer bottom sample could be collected in this way.'The dimensions of the frame in the type most commonly used during the Fish Hawkdredging were 12 by 22 inches. A smaller size (8 by 16 inches) was. however. sometimesused in the Phalarope and Blue Wing work.(3) The third type of dredge employed was the oyster dredge. This was intermediatein size between the beam trawl and the scrape dredge and was very heavilyconstructed. being well adapted to use upon rocky bottoms. The scraping edge at themouth of this implement was armed with powerful spikes or teeth. designed to dig deeplyinto the sand or gravel. The bag of the dredge was made up of iron rings. linkedtogether after the fashion of chain armor. In order to retain the smaller organisms.this chainwork bottom was commonly lined with fine netting. The oyster dredge wasemployed on bottoms too stony for the other appliances. or where it was desired topenetrate more deeply beneath the surface.The Fish Hawk is a steam vessel having a length of 146 feet at the water line. orof 156 feet over all. a beam of 27 feet. and a draft of about 7 feet. She carries adequatemachinery for the reeling in of heavy dredges. and despite her limited speed and unseaworthyconstruction is an extremely serviceable vessel for scientific operations in quietwaters. A full description of the Fish Hawk has already been given by Tanner (1884).and therefore need not be repeated here.The material taken by the Fish Hawk dredges was commonly emptied into a seriesof trays. constituting the table sieve of Verrill and Chester (Verrill. 1883). having gradedmeshes. the coarser ones naturally being uppermost. After a superficial examinationand preliminary search for specimens a stream of salt water was played upon the material.and the sand. mud. and small unattached organisms were thus washed into theunderlying. smaller-meshed trays. The contents of each tray were examined in turn.according to a system to be described later.The Tanner sounding apparatus a was employed at each of the Fish Hawk stations.together with the Sigsbee water specimen cup. and the Negretti-Zambra thermometer.Thus the temperature and density were recorded. as well as the depth of the water.It was later realized. however. that the figures for temperature and density obtainedduring the regular dredging operations were not sufficiently exact for the purposes ofthe work. and. likewise. that no fair comparison would be possible of the differentwaters in the region unless we possessed a set of determinations which had been madenearly or quite simultaneously throughout its entire extent. For this reason a new setof temperature and density observations. taken with standardized instruments andwithin the briefest period possible. was made after the completion of the dredgingwork. Such determinations were repeated several times at intervals of a few months.so that the seasonal conditions are now pretty well known. These will be discussed ina later section.The position of the vessel was determined in the earlier part of the work by meansof an azimuth compass located on the roof of the deck house. just abaft the pilot house.Bearings were taken upon two. sometimes three. landmarks. usually lighthouses. Thiswas commonly done just before the lowering of the dredge. The station. as recordedon the chart. was thus the point where the dredge haul commenced. while thedirection and amount of the drift was estimated rather roughly. Later. tripods wereerected upon a number of Coast Survey triangulation points and sextants were employedin locating the ship's position. Angles were taken simultaneously by two observers.one of whom found the angular distance between X and Y. the other that betweenY and Z. The position of the vessel was determined both at the beginning and at theend of the dredge haul. and frequently at one or two intermediate points. Thus uponthe maps the later stations in Vineyard Sound appear not as single circles but as straightor curved lines. at intervals in which are to .be found the points (a. b. c. etc.) at which? sextant readings were taken.The Phalarope is a steam vessel. originally designed as a yacht. having a length of82 feet at the water line. or of 92 feet over all. and a beam of 16 feet. She draws 7Ufeet of water. and her average speed is probably about II knots. The Phalarope carriesno dredging machinery and is not permanently equipped for this work. In landing thedredge a small derrick was employed. this being operated by hand power. The contentswere emptied upon a special movable platform built over the forward cabin. A set ofsieves was employed similar in principle but smaller than those used on the Fish HouikWith this vessel the use of the beam trawl was impracticable. and even the oyster dredgewas too heavy to be employed very frequently. though it was used to advantage undercertain conditions. The second type of dredge mentioned above was therefore the.principal one employed.Since the Phalarope dredging was. for the most part. done within a quarter of amile from land. it was found to be possible to locate the stations with a fair degree ofaccuracy by reference to features of the shore. Bearings upon lighthouses were notcommonly practicable. nor indeed were they believed to be especially desirable. Thesoundings indicated. with sufficient precision. the distance from land. and the directionof various landmarks was noted. An ideal degree of accuracy in locating these stationsmight have been attained through the sacrifice of much time and effort. but it is doubtfulwhether the scientific value of this report would thereby have been greatly enhanced.In the case of both vessels the same general procedure was adopted in respect tothe listing and the preservation of material. One or more of the authors of this reportaccompanied each dredging trip. and one or several assistants were detailed from thelaboratory staff. On many occasions specialists interested in particular groups oforganisms accompanied us on these expeditions and participated in the identifications.The more obvious and easily recognizable species were listed on the spot. mention beingmade of their relative abundance and other facts of interest. These observations weredictated to an assistant. At the same time samples of the sand. stones. mud. seaweed. etc..and any specimens concerning which the least doubt was entertained were preserved. witha record of the station from which they came. This material was later sorted over in thelaboratory and further species were identified and listed. Those concerning which therewas still any doubt were bottled and subsequently referred to the proper specialists.

NC to Cape Canaveral. FL).Purpose: For thirty years. the Marine Resources Research Institute (MRRI) at the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources (SCDNR). through the Marine Resources Monitoring. Assessment and Prediction (MARMAP) program. has conducted fisheries-independent research on groundfish. reef fish. ichthyoplankton. and coastal pelagic fishes within the region between Cape Lookout. North Carolina. and Ft Pierce. Florida. The overall mission of the program has been to determine distribution. relative abundance. and critical habitat of economically and ecologically important fishes of the South Atlantic Bight (SAB). and to relate these features to environmental factors and exploitation activities. Research toward fulfilling these goals has included trawl surveys (from 6-350 m depth); ichthyoplankton surveys; location and mapping of reef habitat; sampling of reefs throughout the SAB; life history and population studies of priority species; tagging studies of commercially important species and special studies directed at specific management problems in the region. Survey work has also provided a monitoring program that has allowed the standardized sampling of fish populations over time and development of an historical base for future comparisons of long-term trends. Annual MARMAP cruises to assess relative abundance of reef fishes in the sponge-coral and shelf edge (live bottom) habitats of the South Atlantic Bight (SAB) have been conducted since 1978. MARMAP currently samples natural live bottom habitat from Cape Lookout. NC to the Ft. Pierce area. FL. The current main MARMAP objectives are to: (1) Sample reef fishes in the snapper-grouper complex at using a variety of gears in live bottom. rocky outcrop. high relief. and mud bottom habitats. (2) Collect detailed data for time series description of species for annual composition and relative abundance. (3) Obtain population characteristics on fish species of interest through life history information analysis. including age and growth. sex ratio. size and age of sexual maturation and transition. spawning season. fecundity. and diet. Priorities are dictated by the SEDAR schedule and other management considerations. (4) Collect hydrographic data (e.g. depth. temperature. salinity. etc.) for comparison to fish abundance and composition indices. (5) Collect DNA samples from selected fish species for stock identification. (6) Expand sampling area in North Carolina and south Florida as well as reconnoiter new live bottom areas with underwater video (UWTV) to add to the MARMAP site database.

With more than 1900 marine mammal encounters in The Bahamas. we are providing the only comprehensive documentation of the marine mammal fauna in this part of the world. Our research is based on the use of systematic boat-based surveys for describing the distribution and habitat use of different marine mammal species. We employ photo-identification techniques for the recognition of individual whales and dolphins. and we have developed new statistical approaches for using these data to determine abundance estimates and occupancy patterns. This photographic sampling is complemented by the collection of skin and faecal samples for molecular genetic analysis. which are being used to assess levels of genetic diversity and investigate the structuring of marine mammal populations. The dataset presented here includes both marine mammal and turtle sightings. The dataset consists of 89 stranding records between 1944 and 2005. including 15 species with Cuvier?s beaked whale being the most common. Marine mammal sightings data includes 444 sightings between 1988 and 2005. including sightings reported from the public. The dataset includes 1.934 BMMS vessel encounters with marine mammals between 1991 and 2005. comprising 20 different species. with the Atlantic bottlenose dolphin representing 60% of all encounters. Finally. the dataset also includes 101 sightings of turtles comprising 3 different species between 1991 and 2005.

For the survey. we used a Nephrops bottom trawl towed over the bottom during 5 minutes at a speed of approximately 2 knots. A scanmar (1989-1998) or netmind (1999-present) hydro-acoustic instrumentation system is used to monitor the status of the trawl. such as depth. trawl opening width and height.

Seven study areas are defined within the spatial extents outlined here; northern NAFO 0A. southern NAFO 0A. SFA0. SFA1. SFA3 and western Hudson Strait. The study area surveyed varies from year to year. Details of this specific survey are described below. Surveys are conducted with the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources' (GINR) research vessel Paamiut using either an Alfredo or Cosmos shrimp trawl depending on the focus species of the particular survey. The target set for the Alfredo trawl is 3.0 knots towed for 30 minutes and for the Cosmos trawl 2.6 knots for 15 minutes. Trawl geometry is monitored for door spread. net height and bottom contact with wing spread introduced in 2009. Environmental data. temperature. salinity and depth. is collected with Seamon. Star-Oddi and Seabird equipment. Surveys are stratified random in design based on stratum area proportions with a two set minimum. Sampling sites are allocated using the buffered random sampling (BRS) protocol of Kingsley et al. 2004. Shrimp surveys sample waters from 100-800m stratified in contours of 100-200. 200-300. 300-400. 400-600 and 600-800m. Greenland halibut surveys sample waters from 400-1500m. The 2007 multi-species stock assessment survey of SFA3 and RISA was conducted from 12 October to 7 November. Sixty-none of the seventy sets allocated to SFA3 were taken sucessfully with the Cosmos trawl. Seabird 19plus CTD mounted to the headrope was introduced to the survey in 2007. Experimental work was conducted in RISA in two strata south west of Resolution Island looking at the effects of tide/current and survey design on the overall results of the survey. Samples were collected to examine fecundity and stomach contents of both Pandalid species. This dataset is the OBIS version of the stock assessment survey. These data are for display on the OBIS portal and associated mapping programs and for download for end-user analysis. PURPOSE: The survey collects fishery-independent information necessary for the assessment of stock status for the commercial exploited species. northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis) and striped shrimp (Pandalus montagui) and Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides). in SFA3.

By relating the data collected in the field back to the habitat maps and bathymetric models. BT is able to model and map species level and community level information. These protocols are standardized throughout the US Caribbean to enable quantification and comparison of reef fish abundance and distribution trends between locations.Site selection begins by stratifying NOAA's nearshore benthic habitat maps into predetermined habitat strata. Utilizing ArcGIS. sites are then randomly selected within strata throughout the region. Using a handheld GPS unit. the boat captain navigates to previously selected sites. A weighted buoy is dropped to mark any site where live boating is necessary. Once on site. divers are deployed and maintain contact with each other throughout the entirecensus. One diver is responsible for collecting data on the fish communities utilizing the belt transect visual census technique. The belt transect diver obtains a random compass heading prior to entering the water and records the compass bearing (0-360o) on the data sheet. On site. no attempt to avoid structural features within a habitat such as a pile of conch shells. a sand patch or a tire in a seagrass or sand area should be made as these features affect fish communities and are real features of the habitats. Visibility at each site must be sufficient to allow for identification of fish at a minimum of 2m away. Once reasonable visibility is ascertained. the diver attaches a tape measure to the substrate and allows it to roll out as progress is made along the chosen compass heading for a distance of 25m. The transect should take 15 minutes regardless of habitat type or number of animals present. This allows more mobile animals the opportunity to swim through the transect. and standardizes the samples collected to allow for comparisons. As the tape roles out at a relatively constant speed. the diver records all fish species to the lowest taxonomic level possible that come within 2m of either side of the transect. Each survey is 100m2 in area (25m length X 4m width). To decrease the total time spent writing. four letter codes are used that consist of the first two letters of the genus name followed by the first two letters of the species name. In the rare case that two species have the same four-letter code. letters are added to the species name until a difference occurs. If the fish can only be identified to the family or genus level then this is all that is recorded. If the fish cannot be identified to the family level then no entry is necessary. The number of individuals per species is tallied in 5cm size class increments up to 35cm using visual estimation of fork length. If an individual is greater than 35cm. then an estimate of the actual fork length is recorded. Prior to 2002. fork lengths of fish greater than 35 cm were not always recorded. Although the habitat should not be altered in any manner by lifting or moving structure. the observer should record fish seen in holes. under ledges and in the water column. To identify. enumerate. or locate new individuals a diver may move off the centerline of the transect as long as they stay within the 4m transect width and do not look back along area already covered. The diver is allowed to look forward toward the end of the transect for the distance left along the transect (i.e. if the diver is at meter 15. he can look 10 meters distant. but if he is at meter 23. he can only look 2 meters ahead). This diver also takes photos of fishes to document color patterns and phases of the different species.Data Caveats: Overtime. some changes were made to the stratified random site selection process as follows: 1) Habitat strata initially consisted of hard bottom. sand. and seagrass. Sand and seagrass strata were subsequently combined into one soft bottom strata at all three locations (Puerto Rico. St. Croix. and St. John). This action was taken after the February 2002 mission to Puerto Rico. 2) A small subset of sites were resampled during each mission through June 2002 in Puerto Rico and October 2002 in St. Croix. These station names contain the letter 'P' indicating they are permanent stations. 3) The sample area in St. Croix has increased over time. Initially. samples were collected within historic Buck Island National Monument boundaries as well as outside up to a distance of 0.5 km from those boundaries. In February 2002 the sampling effort was increased to include the entire expanded monument boundaries. Finally in April 2003 the effort was increased again to include areas outside of the Monument for control sites. This area is now almost entirely enclosed within the East End Marine Park of St. Croix. 4) The habitat map utilized to stratify the samples in St. Croix was changed from the original habitat map created with a 1 acre minimum mapping unit to one with a 100m2 minimum mapping unit beginning with the April 2003 mission.Process_Date: 200202 Unit of abundance = IndCountInt, Unit of biomass = NA",Traps,NA,  Remove irrelevant data and extract depth to field.

Ahand held GPS receiver and site location sheets. containing maps. colour photographs and writtennotes in laminated plastic. were used to aid relocation.The site numbering system is based on the wave exposure of the shore. The first number (rangingfrom 1 to 6) is based on the Ballantine scale (Ballantine. 1961). which uses the biological communitieson the shore to estimate the wave exposure (where 1 = extremely exposed). The second number is aconsecutive number at that exposure.A fixed datum marker. usually a pat of concrete and/or a paint mark. marks the top of each transect.The line of the transect is defined by a bearing and by reference to conspicuous marks (permanentrock features and distant landmarks) shown in the photographs on the site location sheet. A tape may belaid down the shore from the fixed datum marker at the top of the transect. to provide a visiblereference.Fixed recording stations have been established along the transects at all sites. The stations are locatedat 20 cm height intervals from the fixed datum marker. These stations are marked with paint. wherepossible in the upper shore zones. or relocated by use of a cross staff level (with a 20 cm shaft) and thetape measurements. On the shores with extensive plateaux or very gradual slopes. the tapemeasurements alone are usually reliable. Relocation has been improved since 1993 by usingannotated photographs of transects and close-up photographs of the stations. In most cases these nowallow more rapid and precise relocation of the stations. The number of stations on the transect variesfrom twenty nine stations at West of Mioness (site 1.1) where there is an extensive supralittoral lichenzone. to ten at Scatsta Ness (sites 6.12 and 6.13).Five stations are now monitored on each transect. selected to represent the five major shore zones oflower shore (LS). lower middle shore (LMS). middle shore (MS). upper middle shore (UMS) andupper shore (US) as defined by their relative height above chart datum and their assemblages of plantsand animals.

This grab enables fast sampling. The variability within replicates corresponds to about 13 %. what gives a difference in depth of 0.7 to 1.2 cm (Lie & Pamatmat. 1965). __Processing samples: Every sample (already stained with a Bengal Rose or eosin solution) is decanted (10 times) on a 1000 ?m sieve in order to separate the present fauna from the sediment. With this technique the residue of coarse sediment and fauna is pored into a measuring cup (5 l) and is brought into suspension with a strong jet of water. During this process the smaller and lighter organisms will go into suspension. whereas the heavier sediment and organisms remain on the bottom. The water containing the organisms is there after pored over a 1000 ?m sieve. All retained fauna is stored in a 4-8 % neutral formalin solution and stained with Bengal-Rose of eosin (if not done earlier). Both solutions colour all organic material. This enables easier sorting of the animals. After decantation the residue is checked for bigger and heavier organisms (e.g. Mollusca. Actinaria). Decantation must not be applied to fine sediment samples (< 1000 ?m) as all sediment is directly rinsed through the 1 mm sieve and what remains on the sieve can directly be fixated.     Identification: All organisms are counted and identified. if possible to species level. For some animal groups however this is not the case:Nematoda. Nemertinea. Sipunculida. Turbellaria. Actinaria. Oligochaeta and Copepoda are never identified to a higher level because they are not representative for the macrobenthos community. The sampling technique is not suited to quantify these groups neither.The identification of some taxa is still under discussion. Whether they should be identified up to species level or grouped into complexes is still not clear due to uncertain taxonomy (e.g. Phyllodoce maculata of P. mucosa; Harmotho? spp.; Bathyporeia spp.; Cirratulidae; Capitellidae).    Sediment analysis: Two standard methods were applied: using sieves with different mesh sizesDuring the period 1976-1986 all sediment analyses were done using at least 7 sieves with different mesh size (see table 1). Approximately 25 g of homogenized substrate was used for grain size analysis of the sand fraction according to Buchanan & Kain (1971). The wet-sieved fraction smaller than 63 ?m was used as a measure for mud content.using a Coulter LS 100From 1994 on all sediment samples were analysed using a Coulter counter. Within the measuring range of 2 ?m to 850 ?m the grain sizes are measured. The fraction larger than 850 ?m is separated and expressed as weighed percentage. The subdivision in sediment fractions follows the Wentworth scale (Buchanan. 1984).        Density: All densities are shown as the number of individuals per square meter (ind/m?).

The plot network extends from the coast to the Cascades in western Oregon and Washington and east to ponderosa pine forests in the Oregon Cascades. Most of the permanent plots were established during two intervals: from 1910 to 1948. and from 1970 to 1989. The earlier plots were established by U.S. Forest Service researchers to quantify timber growth in young stands of important commercial species and to help answer other applied forestry questions. The more recent period of plot establishment began under the Coniferous Forest Biome program of the International Biological Program during the 1970s. and continued under the Long-term Ecological Research program. A broader set of objectives motivated plot establishment since 1970. especially quantification of composition. structure. and population and ecosystem dynamics of natural forests. Plots have one of three spatial arrangements: (1) contiguous rectangles subjectively placed within an area of homogeneous forest; (2) circular plots subjectively placed within an area of homogeneous forest; and (3) circular plots systematically located on long transects to sample an entire watershed. ridge. or reserve. Rectangular study areas are mostly 1.0 ha or 0.4 ha (1.0 ac) in size (slope-corrected). Circular plots are 0.1 ha (0.247 ac). not corrected for slope. The tree stratum is the focus of work in closed-forest study areas. All trees larger than a minimum diameter (5 cm for most areas) are permanently tagged. Plots are censused every 5 or 6 years. Attributes measured or assessed at each census include tree diameter. tree vigor. and the condition of the crown and stem. The same attributes are recorded for trees (ingrowth) that have exceeded the minimum diameter since the previous census. In many plots tree locations are surveyed to provide a plot-specific x-y location. A mortality assessment is done for trees that have died since the previous census. The assessment characterizes rooting. stem. and crown condition. obvious signs of distress or disturbance. and the apparent predisposing and proximate causes of tree death. ____ Experimental Design - TV010: Description: The sites were selected subjectively to represent modal examples of the major habitat types in the H.J. Andrews area (usually with a mature and old growth example). Some stands (e.g.riparian) were selected for other reasons. The stands are remeasured at 5 to 10 year intervals to provide growth and regeneration information.Field Methods - TV010 : Description: The stands are surveyed into 25 X 25 slope corrected subplots marked with permanent stakes. All trees greater than the minimum size (usually 5 cm dbh) are tagged. diametered. vigor coded. and mapped. The mapping is done using a 5 X 5 m grid formed with string as a guide.

Habitat relationships derived from the combination of bird and vegetation information surrounding the permanently marked points and from the short-term. management-oriented monitoring protocol have generated the most support for the monitoring program within the USFS. Generating financial support from potential partners has been the most difficult obstacle to expansion beyond USFS lands. but many of those who were resistant early on are beginning to realize the power of birds as monitoring tools. and are starting to join forces to develop a more comprehensive statewide monitoring plan. - http://www.treesearch.fs.fed.us/pubs/32091  (http://www.fs.fed.us/psw/publications/documents/psw_gtr191/psw_gtr191_0956-0962_hutti.pdf   --  http://www.montanadiscoveryfoundation.org/ASC_ptct_protocol_2007.pdf) Unit of abundance = IndCountInt, Unit of biomass = NA",Point counts,NA,1.

The 40 non-riparian sites are a subset of the 200 CAP- LTER points. We are using point counts to survey birds four times a year (January. April. July and October). During each session each point is visited by three birders who count all birds seen or heard for 15 minutes. Our goal is to study how different land-use forms affect bird abundance. distribution and diversity in the greater Phoenix area in order to predict and preserve high bird species diversity as urban development is proceeding. We have now just completed 3 years of monitoring. and are also beginning to see some of the sites changing due to new urban development. The results described below are based on analyses of the first two years? data. _______Bird Point Count Survey - GeneralA point count consists of one person standing in a specific location. for a fixed length of time. at a specific time of day. and counting all birds seen and heard within a specific distance (Fixed Radius.) or as far as the eye can see (Open Radius.)CAP-LTER uses 15-minute observation time spans.Counts are done within 4 hours of local sunrise.Counts are done using the Open Radius method.ADDITIONAL OBSERVERSThe primary observer may be accompanied to the plot area by an additional observer. However. only the primary observer should stand at plot center. and only the observations of the primary observer should be recorded on the data sheet. To avoid any bias that would invalidate the data collected. the secondary observer should not verbalize. point out birds. or give any non-verbal cues to the primary observer.Please note in the Notes column of the data sheet if an additional observer was present during the count.If the secondary observer sees something especially interesting that the primary observer did not see. it may be noted in the Notes column.COUNT CONDITIONSThe first point count should be started no earlier than local sunrise. The final point count should be finished no later than 4 hours past local sunrise.Do not conduct point counts in steady. or heavy rain. (It is okay to conduct counts in light. intermittent drizzle. but be sure to make note of this in the Weather line of the data sheet.)Do not conduct point counts in steady winds above 20 mph.APPROACHING THE PLOTApproach the plot as quietly as possible to minimize disturbance to the birds present.Make note in the Notes column of any birds flushed by the approach in case they do not return during the count.Stand quietly at plot center for 5 minutes before starting the count. This is essential to allow any disturbance caused by the approach to settle down.Use this 5-minute settle-down time to fill out the information at the top of the data sheet.Record in the Notes column any unusual circumstances around the plot. such as construction activity. or if a substantial part of the view is blocked. such as by a wall.CONDUCTING THE COUNTAfter the 5-minute settle-down period. set a watch or timer and conduct the count for 15 minutes. Rotate slowly in place and record all birds seen or heard. For each observation. note the following in the appropriate column of the data sheet.SpeciesUse the AOU code (7th Edition) if known. or write down the complete common name.If the species can not be positively identified. use the closest taxonomic affiliation. (It is better to record something as unknown rather than guessing.)Number of Individuals and DistanceUsually. a single individual bird will be recorded per line.Only record a number greater than one on a single line if birds of the same species are observed very close together. such as a flock or family group.If a mixed flock is observed. put each species on a separate line and note in the Notes column that they were part of a mixed flock.Record estimated flock sizes. only if you cannot count them all. in the following manner: 10-20 or 15+.Write the number of individuals observed in the appropriate distance columns (a meter - 39 inches - is a little bit longer than a yard.)If a bird moves during the count. record only the distance at which it was first observed.Try to be aware of bird movement to minimize counting birds twice.Fly-Throughs (FT)If a bird is seen flying through the count area. below the tallest structure or vegetation. but not observed taking off or landing. record it in the FT column only. not the distance columns. Note also the direction the bird was first observed.Higher flying birds can be noted in the Notes column if it is likely they are aerial screeners using the habitat. such as a hawk circling 100 feet overhead.You may note in the Notes column any unusual fly-overs. such as a flock of Sandhill Cranes.Seen (S) or Heard (H) ColumnsRecord with a check mark whether the bird was identified from sight or sound. or both. Use caution with similar-sounding birds. like Juncos and White-crowned Sparrows. or with mimics and imitators. like Grackles and Starlings.DirectionRecord the direction the bird was first observed. or heard. This may mean recording a bird heard to the south (S) even though you were facing northwest (N/W) at the time.Use the cardinal and midcardinal points of the compass (N. N/E. E. S/E. S. S/W. W. N/W) in this column.ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONSWear drab clothing and avoid bold patterns that might scare away some birds. or attract other ones.Do not pish. squeak. or use any other methods to encourage birds to show themselves. This would artificially inflate the bird densities recorded and invalidate the data collected.If the 15-minute count is interrupted for more than 30 seconds for any reason. such as a homeowner coming up to ask what you are doing. make a note of the interruption in the Notes column. An interruption of 5 minutes or more should also be reflected in the End Time column.Do not start or continue a count if personal safety is threatened in any way.

Birds are being surveyed by both LTER researchers and by local interest groups and individuals (e.g.. Maricopa Audubon Society). A new interactive bird population web site is now posted. One can obtain results for bird censuses that have been going on since 1 May 1998. Volunteers in combination with LTER birders have been censusing birds in over 70 transects located throughout the Phoenix metropolitan area.The goals of this project are (1) to document the changes in avian richness and abundance over time and space. and (2) to determine the biotic/abiotic factors and socioeconomic/political factors that cause these changes to occur. We have developed a census protocol and have started conducting bird censuses in four key habitats in the CAP LTER study area.   ----   Bird transect samplingUsing a stratified random sampling strategy. we have established thirty 1-km transects in four key habitat types within the Phoenix metro area. These habitats include older residential neighborhoods (8 sites). younger residential neighborhoods (8 sites). remnant desert areas (8 sites). and golf courses (8 sites). These sites are located in southern Phoenix. Tempe. Chandler. and Mesa. Desert transects are divided into five 200 meter segments and the other transects are divided into ten 100 meter segments to evaluate the effects of landscape structure at the patch level.

Design characteristics: Estuaries were classified into three classes (or strata): large estuarine systems. small estuarine systems. and large tidal rivers (Holland 1990). Large estuarine systems are defined as systems having surface areas greater than 260 km2 and aspect ratios (length/average width) less than 18. Twelve large estuarine systems with a total surface area of 16.097 km2 or 68% of the Province's estuarine area met these criteria. Large tidal rivers. defined as systems having surface areas greater than 260 km2 and aspect ratios greater than 18. included the Hudson. Potomac. James. Delaware. and Rappahannock Rivers. These five tidal rivers have a total surface area of 2.601 km2 or 11% of the total Province area. Small estuarine systems are defined as systems having surface areas less than 260 km2 but greater than or equal to 2.6 km2 . There were 144 small estuarine systems with a total surface area of 4.875 km2 or 21% of the Province.Sampling sites in the large estuarine class were selected using a randomly placed systematic grid (Holland 1990. Paul et al. 1992). The distance between the systematically spaced sampling points on the grid was approximately 18 km. The grid is an extension of the systematic EMAP grid (Overton et al. 1991). The center points of the grids are the sample sites. A linear analog of the systematic grid was used for site selection in the large tidal rivers (Holland 1990. Paul et al. 1992). The grid was used to define the spine of the five large tidal rivers. with a starting point at the river mouth. The first transect was randomly located between river kilometer 0 and 25. Additional transects were then placed every 25 km up the river to the head of tide. The 144 small estuarine systems were randomly selected from the entire list of small systems in the Province (Holland 1990. Paul et al. 1992). They were ordered from north to south by combining adjacent estuaries into groups of four. One estuary was selected randomly from each group without replacement for each of the four years of sampling. The location of the sample within each selected small system was randomly placed. Application of the sampling design to the three estuarine resource classes resulted in 446 potential sampling sites; however. 21 were unsampleable due to inadequate water depth or inaccessibility. so 425 sites were sampled over the four-year period (Fig. D1).b. Permanent plots: Not applicable.c. Data collection frequency: An index period (July?September) was chosen for estuarine sampling to represent that portion of the year when the measured ecological parameters are expected to show the maximum response to pollutant stress (Connell and Miller 1984. Sprague 1985); dissolved oxygen concentrations are lowest (Officer et al. 1984. USEPA 1984); fauna and flora are most abundant; and within-season variability is expected to be minimized. The Virginian Province survey was conducted annually. during the index period from 1990 through 1993. Generally. each station was visited once. Base Sampling Sites (BSS) are the probability-based sites that form the core of the monitoring design and are the basis of this data paper. Crews sampled 425 base stations during the index period over four years.4. Research methods: An important aspect of the EMAP Virginian Province project was that the data were collected and processed with consistent methods. Field methods are documented in the Field Operations and Safety Manual (Reifsteck et al. 1993). Laboratory methods are given in the EMAP-Estuaries Laboratory Methods Manual (USEPA 1995). A performance-based approach was used for chemical analyses. consistent with the approach used by the NOAA National Status & Trends Program (Valette-Silver 1992). All sampling was conducted from small (24-ft) vessels. except for fish sampling at deep-water stations (> 25m). which were collected from larger vessels.a. Field/laboratory: Water column profiles for water quality parameters were collected using a SeaBird SBE-25 Sea Logger CTD. The unit was equipped with probes to measure salinity. temperature. depth. pH. dissolved oxygen (DO). light transmission. fluorescence. and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Water quality measurements were collected upon arrival at a sampling station; no effort was made to standardize for the time of day or stage of tide. The CTD was equilibrated at the sea surface. then lowered through the water column until reaching a depth of one meter above the bottom where the CTD was allowed to equilibrate again. The unit was then returned to the surface. where data were downloaded to an on-board computer for review and storage. If the CTD cast appeared unusual or failed quality control criteria. the cast was repeated. Beginning in 1991. a bottom water sample was collected. and the dissolved oxygen concentration determined with a YSI Model 58 DO meter. This measurement served as a check on the CTD probe as well as a back-up in case the CTD failed.Three benthic samples. if possible. were collected using a stainless steel. Young-modified van Veen grab that sampled a surface area of 440 cm2. A small core (2-cm diameter) was collected from each grab for sediment grain size. The remaining sample was sieved through a 0.5-mm screen using a backwash technique that minimized damage to soft-bodied animals. Samples were preserved in 10% formalin-rose bengal solution and stored for at least 30 days prior to processing to assure proper fixation. In the laboratory. macrobenthic community samples were transferred from formalin to an ethanol solution and sorted. Biomass was measured for key taxa and all other taxa were grouped according to taxonomic type.Fish were collected by trawling with a 15-m. high-rise otter trawl with a 2.5-cm mesh cod end. The net was towed for 10 minutes against the tide between 0.5 and 1.5 m/s (1?3 knots). All fish caught in the trawl were identified to species and counted; up to 30 individuals of a species from each collection were measured to the nearest millimeter. Individuals collected in standard trawls were inspected for gross external pathological disorders at all stations where fish were collected. This included checking body surface and fins for lumps. growths. ulcers. and fin erosion. Specimens with observed gross pathologies were preserved in Dietrich's solution for subsequent laboratory verification and histological examination.An additional 6?10 sediment grabs at each station were taken for sediment chemistry and toxicity analyses. The top 2 cm of sediment was removed from each grab using a stainless steel spoon and thoroughly homogenized in a stainless steel pot. Sediment for chemistry analyses was placed in clean glass jars with Teflon liners or polypropylene containers (for organic and metals analyses. respectively). shipped on ice. and stored frozen in the laboratory prior to analysis for contaminants. Sediments were analyzed for 24 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). 18 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners. DDTs. 11 chlorinated pesticides. butyl tins. and 15 metals. The chemical analyte list is the same as used in the NOAA NS&T Program (NOAA 1992). An additional aliquot was placed in a small polyethylene bag and refrigerated for grain size analysis. The remainder of the composite sample (> 3.000 mL) was placed in a clean plastic jar for sediment toxicity testing.Toxicity tests were performed on the composite sediment samples from each station using the standard 10-day acute test method (USEPA 1994. USEPA 1995) and the tube-dwelling amphipod Ampelisca abdita. Amphipods were exposed to sediment from the site for 10 d under static conditions in 1-L glass test chambers. Five replicates per station were tested with 20 amphipods per replicate. A performance control was run with each test. as was a water-only test using a reference toxicant (Cu or sodium dodecyl sulfate) to evaluate the condition of the test organisms. Eighty-five percent survival in the sediment control was required for a test to be valid. To normalize for test conditions and amphipod health. survival among treatments is expressed as percent of control survival.Further descriptions of the methods used are given in the Near Coastal Program Plan (Holland 1990). the Virginian Province Implementation Plan (Schimmel 1990). the 1993 Virginian Province Field Operations and Safety Manual (Reifsteck et al. 1993). and the EMAP-Estuaries Laboratory Methods Manual (USEPA 1995).b.

Paul et al. 1992). The distance between the systematically spaced sampling points on the grid was approximately 18 km. The grid is an extension of the systematic EMAP grid (Overton et al. 1991). The center points of the grids are the sample sites. A linear analog of the systematic grid was used for site selection in the large tidal rivers (Holland 1990. Paul et al. 1992). The grid was used to define the spine of the five large tidal rivers. with a starting point at the river mouth. The first transect was randomly located between river kilometer 0 and 25. Additional transects were then placed every 25 km up the river to the head of tide. The 144 small estuarine systems were randomly selected from the entire list of small systems in the Province (Holland 1990. Paul et al. 1992). They were ordered from north to south by combining adjacent estuaries into groups of four. One estuary was selected randomly from each group without replacement for each of the four years of sampling. The location of the sample within each selected small system was randomly placed. Application of the sampling design to the three estuarine resource classes resulted in 446 potential sampling sites; however. 21 were unsampleable due to inadequate water depth or inaccessibility. so 425 sites were sampled over the four-year period (Fig. D1).b. Permanent plots: Not applicable.c. Data collection frequency: An index period (July?September) was chosen for estuarine sampling to represent that portion of the year when the measured ecological parameters are expected to show the maximum response to pollutant stress (Connell and Miller 1984. Sprague 1985); dissolved oxygen concentrations are lowest (Officer et al. 1984. USEPA 1984); fauna and flora are most abundant; and within-season variability is expected to be minimized. The Virginian Province survey was conducted annually. during the index period from 1990 through 1993. Generally. each station was visited once. Base Sampling Sites (BSS) are the probability-based sites that form the core of the monitoring design and are the basis of this data paper. Crews sampled 425 base stations during the index period over four years.4. Research methods: An important aspect of the EMAP Virginian Province project was that the data were collected and processed with consistent methods. Field methods are documented in the Field Operations and Safety Manual (Reifsteck et al. 1993). Laboratory methods are given in the EMAP-Estuaries Laboratory Methods Manual (USEPA 1995). A performance-based approach was used for chemical analyses. consistent with the approach used by the NOAA National Status & Trends Program (Valette-Silver 1992). All sampling was conducted from small (24-ft) vessels. except for fish sampling at deep-water stations (> 25m). which were collected from larger vessels.a. Field/laboratory: Water column profiles for water quality parameters were collected using a SeaBird SBE-25 Sea Logger CTD. The unit was equipped with probes to measure salinity. temperature. depth. pH. dissolved oxygen (DO). light transmission. fluorescence. and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Water quality measurements were collected upon arrival at a sampling station; no effort was made to standardize for the time of day or stage of tide. The CTD was equilibrated at the sea surface. then lowered through the water column until reaching a depth of one meter above the bottom where the CTD was allowed to equilibrate again. The unit was then returned to the surface. where data were downloaded to an on-board computer for review and storage. If the CTD cast appeared unusual or failed quality control criteria. the cast was repeated. Beginning in 1991. a bottom water sample was collected. and the dissolved oxygen concentration determined with a YSI Model 58 DO meter. This measurement served as a check on the CTD probe as well as a back-up in case the CTD failed.Three benthic samples. if possible. were collected using a stainless steel. Young-modified van Veen grab that sampled a surface area of 440 cm2. A small core (2-cm diameter) was collected from each grab for sediment grain size. The remaining sample was sieved through a 0.5-mm screen using a backwash technique that minimized damage to soft-bodied animals. Samples were preserved in 10% formalin-rose bengal solution and stored for at least 30 days prior to processing to assure proper fixation. In the laboratory. macrobenthic community samples were transferred from formalin to an ethanol solution and sorted. Biomass was measured for key taxa and all other taxa were grouped according to taxonomic type.Fish were collected by trawling with a 15-m. high-rise otter trawl with a 2.5-cm mesh cod end. The net was towed for 10 minutes against the tide between 0.5 and 1.5 m/s (1?3 knots). All fish caught in the trawl were identified to species and counted; up to 30 individuals of a species from each collection were measured to the nearest millimeter. Individuals collected in standard trawls were inspected for gross external pathological disorders at all stations where fish were collected. This included checking body surface and fins for lumps. growths. ulcers. and fin erosion. Specimens with observed gross pathologies were preserved in Dietrich's solution for subsequent laboratory verification and histological examination.An additional 6?10 sediment grabs at each station were taken for sediment chemistry and toxicity analyses. The top 2 cm of sediment was removed from each grab using a stainless steel spoon and thoroughly homogenized in a stainless steel pot. Sediment for chemistry analyses was placed in clean glass jars with Teflon liners or polypropylene containers (for organic and metals analyses. respectively). shipped on ice. and stored frozen in the laboratory prior to analysis for contaminants. Sediments were analyzed for 24 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). 18 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners. DDTs. 11 chlorinated pesticides. butyl tins. and 15 metals. The chemical analyte list is the same as used in the NOAA NS&T Program (NOAA 1992). An additional aliquot was placed in a small polyethylene bag and refrigerated for grain size analysis. The remainder of the composite sample (> 3.000 mL) was placed in a clean plastic jar for sediment toxicity testing.Toxicity tests were performed on the composite sediment samples from each station using the standard 10-day acute test method (USEPA 1994. USEPA 1995) and the tube-dwelling amphipod Ampelisca abdita. Amphipods were exposed to sediment from the site for 10 d under static conditions in 1-L glass test chambers. Five replicates per station were tested with 20 amphipods per replicate. A performance control was run with each test. as was a water-only test using a reference toxicant (Cu or sodium dodecyl sulfate) to evaluate the condition of the test organisms. Eighty-five percent survival in the sediment control was required for a test to be valid. To normalize for test conditions and amphipod health. survival among treatments is expressed as percent of control survival.Further descriptions of the methods used are given in the Near Coastal Program Plan (Holland 1990). the Virginian Province Implementation Plan (Schimmel 1990). the 1993 Virginian Province Field Operations and Safety Manual (Reifsteck et al. 1993). and the EMAP-Estuaries Laboratory Methods Manual (USEPA 1995).b.

In previous studies the Harvard Forest Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) program has developed an integrated approach of paleoecological and historical reconstruction meteorological modeling air photo interpretation GIS analyses and field studies of vegetation and soils to address fundamental ecological questions concerning the rates direction and causes of vegetation change to evaluate controls over modern species and community distributions and landscape patterns and to provide critical background for conservation and restoration planning. In the current study we extend this approach to investigate the link between landscape history and the abundance distribution and dynamics of species communities and landscapes of the Cape Cod to Long Island coastal region including the islands of Martha's Vineyard Nantucket and Block Island. The study region includes many areas of high conservation priority that are linked geographically historically and ecologically. Despite the compelling rationale for examining this coastal region as a whole and for comparing its related though distinctive geographic areas an integrated and comprehensive study of the region has never been undertaken.We are investigating regional controls over landscape patterns and community distribution and will focus in detail on the dynamics of sandplain communities including grasslands heathlands barrens and woodlands which are unique components of this region and high priorities for conservation. In order to determine the historical and modern abundance and distribution of these community types and to relate these to historical patterns of land use fire windstorms and other disturbances we are developing: (1) GIS-based spatially explicit maps of land use land cover environment hurricane characteristics and cultural features across the region for the historical period (17th C to present) (2) pollen and charcoal diagrams for critical areas where data are currently unavailable and an integrated analysis of data from all studies across this region (3) analysis of the relationship between high priority communities (sandplain grasslands heathlands barrens and related communities) rare species and disturbance history (4) revised conceptual ecological models for sandplain communities and recommendations for ecological goals and management approaches.Methods:Species List - The data file lists all taxa recorded in the sample plots. Taxonomy follows Gleason and Cronquist (1991). In general codes are formed by taking the first four letters of the genus name and the first three letters of the species name. Where this causes confusion an eight letter code unique to each taxon is used.Plot Locations  - Plots are identified by a general location code (2-3 letters) and a plot number (1-999). These two identifiers are also combined into a single six-character code. Because the plots were sampled from a larger set of potential plot locations plot numbers are not necessarily sequential. Total number of plots = 776 (270 in 1999 389 in 2000 117 in 2001).Soil Chemistry - For plots sampled in 1999 (CJ series) the two pairs of 0-15 and 15-30 cm samples were subsampled (1/8 cup per sample) and combined to make a single composite sample representing the plot which was then sent to Brookside Labs. For plots sampled in 2000 only one set of 0-15 and 15-30 cm samples was collected and ? cup of each was mixed to produce a composite 0-30 cm sample sent for analysis. In some samples concentrations of certain cations were below the detection limit of the analytical equipment; in these cases concentrations are listed as ?less than x ppm.? Before the soils data can be analyzed quantitatively these entries will need to be replaced by numerical values. There are no lab soils data for two plots sampled in 2000 (MT 50 and PB 14).Plant Cover - Cover of all vascular plant species rooted within the 20 x 20 m plot (also total lichen and bryophyte cover) was estimated on an eight-point scale.Tree Diameters - Diameters of all live trees at least 2.5 cm dbh and all standing dead stems at least 10 cm dbh were measured in all plots. Only truly arboreal species were measured; shrubs such as scrub oak and viburnum were not although individuals of these species routinely exceeded 2.5 cm dbh.Tree Cores - One to three cores of the largest sound trees were sampled in plots with trees greater than 5 cm dbh. Cores were taken at 30 cm above the ground. Most cores were mounted sanded and counted under a hand lens or microscope.

Trees >=2 to <=10-cm dbh were sampled in only 42 of the 360 25 x 25-m plots. DATA DESCRIPTION - The data consist of the diameters (dbh) of all trees >=10cm dbh live and dead in the whole of the watershed. (16286 individual stems). Dead trees were recorded as standing dead trees (trees dead but retaining most of their fine branches) and as snags (trees broken off above dbh or with only their major large branches still intact). Live trees were noted sick if they had very sparse foliage or yellowing foliage in the mid summer sampling. The presence and effect of beech bark disease was also noted. Diseased beech showed signs of beech bark disease (cankers) but did not otherwise show evidence of crown decline. Diseased beech with crown in decline had both cankers and were showing signs of physiological stress. Trees >=2cm dbh and <=10cm dbh were measured at the same time on a subset of the plots (1989 individual stems). All stems that met the size criteria were measured individually and in some years it was noted whether a stem was part of a group of stems from the same tree (i.e. multiple stems that split from a single trunk below breast height). For W5 whether or not a stem was part of a group was not recorded in this pre-cut survey.8. For 1990: The inventory consists of all trees >=1.5-cm dbh within 199 circular plots (1.37-m radius) on the lower two-thirds of the watershed (low and mid elevations). Plots were not located within specific grid units as is generally the case but along temporary transects. There were 17 plots sampled with no trees large enough to meet the survey criteria.

Sampling was usually done on a biweekly schedule during the open water period and at least once through the ice at the deepest region of each lake. although in some years lakes Waubesa and Kegonsa were only sampled monthly during the open-water period. On a few dates during high winds or during winter. sampling was conducted in slightly shallower water than at the deepest lake location. Tow depths for Mendota and Monona are included in the data set. Tow depths for Waubesa and Kegonsa have not been transcribed yet. but generally ranged between 9.5-10.0 meters and 7.5-8.0 meters. respectively. The conical zooplankton net had a 15-cm diameter opening (small net) and a net filtering area to opening area ratio of about 11. The net was made of Nitex screening with a mesh size of 75-80 um (#20 net) for all years except for 1976 when the mesh size was about 153 um (#10 net). The smaller-meshed net was initially chosen so that rotifers would be quantitatively collected along with crustacean zooplankton. For the small net. a vertical tow sample was taken from approximately 0.5 m off the lake bottom. The net was pulled to the lake surface at approximately 0.3 m per sec. After the net was raised and the sides rinsed. the sample was transferred to a bottle and preserved with formalin in early years. sugared formalin for a few years. and then formalin plus seltzer water was the preservative used after 1986. For each zooplankton sample obtained by the small net. organisms were identified to species and enumerated in three separate 1-mL subsamples obtained by a Hensen-Stemple pipette. Subsamples were taken directly from the sample bottle (sample volume ca. 150-250 mL). transferred to a 1-mL Sedgewick-Rafter cell and counted using a compound microscope. For each subsample. individual body lengths for all Daphnia encountered were recorded using an eyepiece micrometer; 5-10 organisms of other cladocerans and various life stages of copepods (i.e.. nauplii. copepidites. and adults) were also measured. Based on specified size criteria. juvenile and adult Daphnia of each species were recorded separately. These size criteria were given in Luecke et al. (1990) for samples collected in 1976-1989. The criteria varied in subsequent years but were generally 1.3 mm for D. pulicaria. 1.2 mm for D. mendotae. the most common Daphnia species encountered. If smaller Daphnia were encountered with eggs in their brood chamber. then the adult size was adjusted. Thus. the distinction of adult versus juvenile Daphnia densities recorded in each sample must be viewed as only an index of the two age groups. Calanoid and cyclopoid copepodites were counted separately as two distinct groups without regard to species or life stages. All nauplii were counted as a single group with no distinction made between calanoid and cyclopoid species. All densities and length measurements in the three subsamples were then averaged for each species' life stage. Numerical density estimates (N per meter squared) for each species or zooplankton group as reported in the data set were then computed by multiplying the average subsample count by the subsampling dilution factor (i.e.. volume of sample in bottle) and then dividing by the net opening area (0.01767 meter squared). Biomass estimates for each species or zooplankton group (gram per meter squared) can then be computed using the average length (mm) recorded in the data set using length-weight relationships published in the literature. One caveat for interpreting the zooplankton data for 1976-1994 is that the net efficiency of the vertical tow net used is less than 100%. and also variable depending on the amount of algae clogging the net (Lathrop 1998). Under clear water conditions (Secchi disc greater than 8 m). the net efficiency of the small net was determined to be approximately 58%. However. net efficiency was only about 42% during a period with moderate blue-green algal densities (Secchi disc 1.8 m). The relatively small mesh size (75-80 um) of the net was initially chosen in order to capture rotifers. which are recorded in the database. Beginning in 1991 a larger 30-cm diameter (large) net with a 75-80 um mesh size was also used. which became the standard sampling net used in 1995 coincident with the lake sampling program being conducted by the North Temperate Lakes Long-Term Ecological Research (NTL-LTER) Project. After 1994. the small net was no longer used for sampling zooplankton on the Yahara lakes. This data set also contains large net data for years 1991 through 1994 for Mendota and for 1994 for Monona. Leptodora counts from the small net are available for Mendota (1976-1989). Monona (1976-1987). Kegonsa and Waubesa (1976-1985). Leptodora counts from the large net are available for Mendota (1991-1993). All Leptodora counts were performed on the entire sample by dumping the sample bottle into a container. Individual length measurements for some zooplankton sampled with the small net are available for Mendota (1988-1989. 1992-1994) and Monona (1994). Individual length measurements for zooplankton sampled with the large net are available for Mendota (1991-1993). Daphnia eggs counts (number of eggs per adult daphnia in the sample) from samples taken with the small net are included for Mendota (1976-1991). Monona (1976-1993 except 1989). and Kegonsa and Waubesa (1976-1985). Egg counts represent the combined number of free eggs found in each subsample plus eggs still remaining in adult Daphnia as many times adult Daphnia had eggs expelled from their brood chambers once the preservative was added (especially in years when the preservative was just formalin). Once the total number of eggs for either D. pulicaria or D. mendotae was counted. then the estimate of the number of eggs per adult Daphnia was calculated while recognizing that the criteria for separating adult versus juvenile Daphnia is not without error. Thus. the number of eggs per adult number is best used as an index to determine if the Daphnia population was increasing or not growing due to food limitation.

Excel spreadsheets are used for data entry and file names should begin with the overall study (npp) followed by the date (mm.dd.yy) and the initials of the recorder (.abc). Finally the site abbreviation should be added (i.e. c g b p). The final format should be as follows: npp.mm.dd.yy.abcg.xls. File names should be in lowercase.A 1-m2 PVC-frame is placed over the fiberglass stakes that mark the diagonal corners of each quadrat. When measuring cover it is important to stay centered over the vegetation in the quadrat to prevent errors caused by angle of view (parallax). Each PVC-frame is divided into 100 squares with nylon string. The dimensions of each square are 10cm x 10cm and represent 1 percent of the total area.The cover (area) and height of each individual live (green) vegetative unit that falls within the one square meter quadrat is measured. A vegetative unit consists of an individual size class (as defined by a unique cover and height) of a particular species within a quadrat. Cover is quantified by counting the number of 10cm x 10cm squares filled by each vegetative unit.Niners and plexidecs are additional tools that help accurately determine the cover a vegetative unit. A niner is a small hand-held PVC frame that can be used to measure canopies. Like the larger PVC frame it is divided into 10cm x 10cm squares each square representing 1% of the total cover. However there are only nine squares within the frame hence the name ?niner.? A plexidec can help determine the cover of vegetative units with covers less than 1%. Plexidecs are clear plastic squares that are held above vegetation. Each plexidec represents a cover of 0.5% and has smaller dimensions etched onto the surface that correspond to 0.01% 0.05% 0.1% and 0.25% cover.It is extremely important that cover and height measurements remain consistent over time to ensure that regressions based on this data remain valid. Field crew members should calibrate with each other to ensure that observer bias does not influence data collection.Cover Measurements:Grasses-To determine the cover of a grass clump envision a perimeter around the central mass or densest portion of the plant excluding individual long leaves wispy ends or more open upper regions of the plant. Live foliage is frequently mixed with dead foliage in grass clumps and this must be kept in mind during measurement as our goal is to measure only plant biomass for the current season. In general recently dead foliage is yellow and dead foliage is gray. Within reason try to include only yellow or green portions of the plant in cover measurement while excluding portions of the plant that are gray. This is particularly important for measurements made in the winter when there is little or no green foliage present. In winter sometimes measurements will be based mainly on yellow foliage. Stoloniferous stems of grasses that are not rooted should be ignored. If a stem is rooted it should be recorded as a separate observation from the parent plant.Forbs-The cover of forbs is measured as the perimeter of the densest portion of the plant. If the forb is an annual it is acceptable to include the inflorescence in this measurement. If the forb is a perennial do not include the inflorescence as part of the cover measurement. Measure all foliage that was produced during the current season including any recently dead (yellow) foliage. Avoid measuring gray foliage that died in a previous season.Cacti-For cacti that consist of a series of pads or jointed stems (Opuntia phaecantha Opuntia imbricata) measure the length and width of each pad to the nearest cm instead of cover and height. Cacti that occur as a dense ball/clump of stems (Opuntia leptocaulis) are measured using the same protocol as shrubs. Pincushion or hedgehog cacti (Escobaria vivipara Schlerocactus intertextus Echinocereus fendleri) that occur as single (or clustered) cylindrical stems are measured as a single cover.Yuccas-Make separate observations for the leaves and caudex (thick basal stem). Break the observations into sections of leaves that are approximately the same height and record the cover as the perimeter around this group of leaf blades. The caudex is measured as a single cover. The thick leaves of yuccas make it difficult to make a cover measurement by centering yourself over the caudex of the plant. The cover of the caudex may be estimated by holding a niner next to it or using a tape measure to measure to approximate the area.Height Measurements:Height is recorded as a whole number in centimeters. All heights are vertical heights but they are not necessarily perpendicular to the ground if the ground is sloping.Annual grasses and all forbs-Measure the height from the base of the plant to the top of the inflorescence (if present). Otherwise measure to the top of the green foliage.Perennial grasses-Measure the height from the base of the plant to the top of the live green foliage. Do not include the inflorescence in the height measurement. The presence of live green foliage may be difficult to see in the winter. Check carefully at the base of the plant for the presence of green foliage. If none is found it may be necessary to pull the leaf sheaths off of several plants outside the quadrat. From this you may be able to make some observations about where green foliage is likely to occur.Perennial shrub and sub-shrubs-Measure the height from the base of the green foliage to the top of the green foliage ignoring all bare stems. Do not measure to the ground unless the foliage reaches the ground.Plants rooted outside but hanging into a quadrat-Do not measure the height from the ground. Measure only the height of the portion of the plant that is within the quadrat.Foliage canopy cover:Cover and height are recorded for all separate vegetative units that fall within an infinite vertical column that is defined by the inside edge of the PVC-frame. A vegetative unit consists of an individual species with a unique cover and height. This includes vegetation that is rooted outside of the frame but has foliage that extends into the vertical column defined by the PVC-frame.As mentioned above cover is quantified by counting the number or fraction of 10 cm x 10 cm squares intercepted by each vegetative unit. It is possible to obtain a total percent cover greater than 100 for a quadrat because vegetative units often overlap (especially in shrubs and succulents). For perennial plants cover is based only on the vegetative portion of the plant (stem and leaf). For annual plants cover is based on both vegetative and reproductive (inflorescence) portions of the plant.If the cover of a vegetative unit is less than 1 the increments used are as follows: 0.01 0.05 0.1 0.25 0.5 and 0.75. If cover is between 1 and 5 increments of 0.5 are used and if greater than 5 increments of 1 are used.  Finally if the cover is greater than 15 the total canopy cover is divided into smaller units and the cover and heights of each observation measured separately. This reduces the size of harvest samples.

Net primary production is a fundamental ecological variable that quantifies rates of carbon consumption and fixation. Estimates of NPP are important in understanding energy flow at a community level as well as spatial and temporal responses to a range of ecological processes.Above-ground net primary production is the change in plant biomass represented by stems flowers fruit and and foliage over time and incoporates growth as well as loss to death and decomposition. To measure this change the vegetation variables in this dataset including species composition and the cover and height of individuals are sampled twice yearly (spring and fall) at permanent 1m x 1m plots within each site. A third sampling at Site C is performed in the winter. The data from these plots is used to build regressions correlating biomass and volume via weights of select harvested species obtained in SEV157 Net Primary Productivity (NPP) Weight Data. This biomass data is included in SEV182 Seasonal Biomass and Seasonal and Annual NPP for Core Research Sites.Methods: Locating the Sampling Quadrats: Site P the pinon-juniper woodland site (Cerro Montosa) is set-up differently than the other core sites. In order to accommodate the different habitat types groups of transects (i.e. plots) were set up along north (N) and south (S) facing slopes as well as along vegas (V) and ridges (R). Transects on the first two plots consist of 40 quads each (10 quadrants for each of four habitat types). Plot one is slightly west of plot three and plot two is slightly west of the weather station. Plot three is located on a wide piedmont which consists of four transects with five quadrats on each.Collecting the Data: Net primary production data is collected twice each year spring and fall for all sites. The Five Points Creosote Core Site is also sampled in winter. Spring measurements are taken in April or May when shrubs and spring annuals have reached peak biomass. Fall measurements are taken in either September or October when summer annuals have reached peak biomass but prior to killing frosts. Winter measurements are taken in February before the onset of spring growth.Vegetation data is collected on a palm top computer.

Stoloniferous stems of grasses that are not rooted should be ignored. If a stem is rooted it should be recorded as a separate observation from the parent plant.Forbs shrubs and sub-shrubs (non-creosote)-The cover of forbs shrubs and sub-shrubs is measured as the horizontal area of the plant. If the species is an annual it is acceptable to include the inflorescence in this measurement if it increases cover. If the species is a perennial do not include the inflorescence as part of the cover measurement. Measure all foliage that was produced during the current season including any recently dead (yellow) foliage. Avoid measuring gray foliage that died in a previous season.Cacti-For cacti that consist of a series of pads or jointed stems (Opuntia phaecantha Opuntia imbricata) measure the length and width of each pad to the nearest cm instead of cover and height.

Measure only the height of the portion of the plant that is within the quadrat. Creosote Measurements: To measure creosote (i.e. Larrea tridenta) break the observations into two categories:1.) Small individual clusters of foliage on a branch (i.e. branch systems): Measure the horizontal cover of each live (i.e. green) foliage cluster ignoring small open spaces (keeping in mind the 15% guideline stated above). Then measure the vertical height of each cluster from the top of the foliage to a plane created by extending a line horizontally from the bottom of the foliage. Each individual foliage cluster within a bush is considered a separate observation.2.) Stems: Measure the length of each stem from the base to the beginning of live (i.e. green) foliage. Calculate the cumulative total of all stem measurements. This value is entered under height with the species as stem for each quadrat containing creosote. All other variable receive a default entry of 1 for creosote stem measurements.Do not measure dead stems or areas of dead foliage. If in doubt about whether a stem is alive scrape the stem with your fingernail and check for the presence of green cambium.Recording the Data: Excel spreadsheets are used for data entry and file names should begin with the overall study (npp) followed by the date (mm.dd.yy) and the initials of the recorder (.abc).

After having been submitted to logging in the late 19th and early 20th centuries followed by a major fire in 1923 the forest is currently in a transition state dominated by pioneer canopy tree species. The sampling design is based on the annual re-sampling of 43 permanent 400-m2 plots along five transects running parallel to an elevation gradient from a lake (Lac Croche) to the top of a hill. Abundances of all understory vascular plants (tree seedlings herbs and shrubs) are included in the data set and are expressed either as absolute densities or cover classes depending on life form. The location and elevation of each plot as well as some key environmenatl descriptors such as slope rockiness canopy openness age of the largest tree basal area of mature trees and a number of soil variables are also available. The Lac Croche data set should prove useful for testing hypotheses about forest vegetation dynamics at different sacles as well as to test new statistical tools developed for the analysis of the spatio-temporal variation of plant distributions. Sampling is ongoing and new data will be added every year   ________    Site description: The study site is located within the SBL (Fig. 1) which is located north of Montr?al in St-Hippolyte Qu?bec Canada. The SBL was acquired in 1963 by the D?partement des Sciences biologiques (Universit? de Montr?al) as a long-term research facility. Located at the foot of the Laurentides geological formation (part of the Canadian Shield) it is part of the sugar maple - yellow birch ecological region. The territory is mostly forested with several lakes and bogs typical of the region. The SBL (46?58? ? 46?01?N 73?57? - 74?01?W) covers 16.5 km2 of mountainous irregular ground with much evidence of the Wisconsinian glaciation (e.g. erratic boulders). Bedrock is primarily composed of anorthosite. Altitude varies from 270m to 450m. Mean annual temperature is 3.9?C and annual precipitations average 1153 mm of which 26% falls as snow (1970-2000 averages; SIMAT 2000). While the climax forest type on mesic sites in the region is typically Acer saccharum - Betula alleghaniensis forest a large number of mesic sites are currently in transition states that are dominated by A. rubrum and pioneer tree species such as B. papyrifera and Populus grandidentata (Savage 2001). This is likely due to perturbations such as logging episodes early in the 19th and 20th century as well as a fire which occurred in 1923 (Lortie 1979). Conifers are dominant on hydric and xeric sites. On August 1st 2006 a windstorm with 100 km/h winds created gaps in the canopy where patches of large pioneer species were still present.Sampling design: The data were collected during a plant ecology field course (BIO3753) given each summer in mid-August by the D?partement de sciences biologiques Universit? de Montr?al. Five permanent transects were established in 1998 at the north-eastern tip of Lac Croche (Fig. 1). Transects are separated by about 50 m. The transects which run more or less parallel to each other at an azimuth of 074? start at the edge of the lake and follow an elevation gradient uphill. Along the transects 43 permanent plots were established (1998) approximately every 50 m. Their location is marked by permanent steel rods in their center. Plots are 20 ? 20 m (400 m2). Sampling of the Lac Croche transects takes approximately three days to complete; the dates given in the data set is that of the first sampling day each year.Within each plot the cover of herbaceous and shrub species was assessed every year usinga modified Braun-Blanquet (1932)semi-quantitative cover scale (Table 1) (Barbour et al. 1999). Tree seedlings (DBH < 1 cm) were also inventoried within two classes according to height (smaller or taller than 30 cm) (Table 2) using ten 1 m x 1 m sub-plots that were established every 2 m along the center of each plot following the transect axis. Within each sub-plot all tree seedlings were counted and identified to species. Data from those ten sub-plots were then pooled and multiplied by 40 to give an estimate of tree seedling abundance over the whole 400 m2 plot. In 1998 2000 and 2001 the two classes of seedlings were joined. Tree seedlings were not inventoried in 1999.A number of abiotic and biotic environmental variables were also evaluated. In 2005 all mature trees (DBH > 10 cm) were identified to species and their diameter at breast height (DBH) measured. The total basal area (BA) per species was then calculated for each plot. A pedon was dug just outside each plot (in order not to disturb the area for subsequent years). From this pedon the following edaphic variables were evaluated: thickness of the organic (O) horizon thickness of horizon A presence of eluviation (E horizon) (Soil Survey Division Staff 1993) and maximum root depth. Pedons were as deep as necessary to collect all variables. Slope was measured using a clinometer (PM-5 model Suunto Vantaa Finland) and slope orientation was measured using a compass. Slope shape was judged on a qualitative scale (concave convex or regular). Surface rockiness (including exposed bedrock) was evaluated on the modified Braun-Blanquet cover scale (Table 1). Canopy openness was measured with Gap Light Analyzer (Frazer et al. 2000) from hemispherical photographs of the canopy taken in the middle of each plot at one meter above ground. Geographic coordinates as well as elevation were measured with a differential GPS receiver (Trimble Navigation Ltd. Sunnyvale CA USA) with estimated 2-m accuracy.

The top 3 recorded species are Rutilus rutilus (27%) Gobio gobio (10%) and Anguilla anguilla (7%).         Sampling Methods: The three sampling methods that were applied in this project (cooling water intertidal and subtidal fykes) proved to be complementary and each are useful to describe a different aspect of the migration of diadromous fishes. The volunteer network (intertidal fykes) has a high temporal and spatial resolution. Especially the catadromous species that use the estuary as a foraging and nursery area were caught in the intertidal fyke nets. Subadult shads and downstream migrating juvenile lampreys were only caught in the cooling water of the powerplant of Doel. In addition the fish monitoring of the cooling water in Doel started in 1991 which allows us to investigate long-term trends. The subtidal fyke nets that were deployed underneath the migration barriers proved to be efficient in catching the fishes during their spawning run. During their upstream migration anadromous fishes accumulate underneath the barriers where they can be caught in large numbers. migration of diadromous fishes data from the river Scheldt Unit of abundance = IndCountInt, Unit of biomass = NA",Sites,NA,1.

The average generating capacity and the combined water flow velocity of the first plant is4.680 J and 69 m3 s _ 1. and those of the second plant is 7.056 J and 80 m3 s _ 1. There was no change inoperation that can result in significant changes in the pumped volume. so the combined water flow wasconstant over years. However. each generator was shut down for maintenance in turn for about onemonth during winter to spring seasons. which causes the combined water flow velocity to decrease 50%.The sample was collected in opportune days in order to avoid sampling during the maintenance period.Over 6.000.000 m3 of water. taken from the near-shore waters off northeastern Taiwan. was used monthlyby these two nuclear power plants.The intake of the first plant was built on a straighter shoreline than that of the second plant. which islocated in an open bay along the Yehliu Cape.

Purpose A summary of why the data was collected.For thirty years. the Marine Resources Research Institute (MRRI) at the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources (SCDNR). through the Marine Resources Monitoring. Assessment and Prediction (MARMAP) program. has conducted fisheries-independent research on groundfish. reef fish. ichthyoplankton. and coastal pelagic fishes within the region between Cape Lookout. North Carolina. and Ft Pierce. Florida. The overall mission of the program has been to determine distribution. relative abundance. and critical habitat of economically and ecologically important fishes of the South Atlantic Bight (SAB). and to relate these features to environmental factors and exploitation activities. Research toward fulfilling these goals has included trawl surveys (from 6-350 m depth); ichthyoplankton surveys; location and mapping of reef habitat; sampling of reefs throughout the SAB; life history and population studies of priority species; tagging studies of commercially important species and special studies directed at specific management problems in the region. Survey work has also provided a monitoring program that has allowed the standardized sampling of fish populations over time and development of an historical base for future comparisons of long-term trends.Annual MARMAP cruises to assess relative abundance of reef fishes in the sponge-coral and shelf edge (live bottom) habitats of the South Atlantic Bight (SAB) have been conducted since 1978. MARMAP currently samples natural live bottom habitat from Cape Lookout. NC to the Ft. Pierce area. FL. The current main MARMAP objectives are to:(1) Sample reef fishes in the snapper-grouper complex at using a variety of gears in live bottom. rocky outcrop. high relief. and mud bottom habitats.(2) Collect detailed data for time series description of species for annual composition and relative abundance.(3) Obtain population characteristics on fish species of interest through life history information analysis. including age and growth. sex ratio. size and age of sexual maturation and transition. spawning season. fecundity. and diet. Priorities are dictated by the SEDAR schedule and other management considerations.(4) Collect hydrographic data (e.g. depth. temperature. salinity. etc.) for comparison to fish abundance and composition indices.(5) Collect DNA samples from selected fish species for stock identification.(6) Expand sampling area in North Carolina and south Florida as well as reconnoiter new live bottom areas with underwater video (UWTV) to add to the MARMAP site database.

U.S. Forest Service personnel established 246 0.2-acre (809 m2) continuous forest inventory (CFI) plots on a 2 Ã— 5 chain (40.2 Ã— 100.6 m) grid (2 chain spacing on north-south lines) over the entire RNA (Fig. 2). Plot centers were marked with steel pipes. Stems >5 in (12.7 cm) diameter at 1.4 m height (diameter at breast height. DBH) were tallied by species in 1-inch (2.54 cm) diameter classes for most plots (n = 236). In 1948. alternate plots along N-S lines were censused in the same manner (n = 123).In 1974â€“1980. under the direction of Dr. Frederick Metzger of the U.S. Forest Service. all CFI plots were recensused. with all woody stems >0.5 in (1.27 cm) DBH recorded by species and DBH to nearest 0.1 inch using Biltmore 'cruising sticks' (Frederick Metzger. personal communication). Standing dead stems > 10 in (25.4 cm) DBH and with bark intact were also recorded. but probably not consistently (see below). Data for three plots have not been relocated (n = 243). Active Forest Service research at the RNA was suspended following closure of the Forest Service Northern Hardwoods Laboratory in Marquette. MI in the early 1980s. Some species. occurring primarily as large shrubs. may not have been consistently recorded (Acer spicatum. Alnus sp. Amelanchier sp. Cornus sp. Corylus cornuta).Beginning in 1989 and continuing over the next several years. I initiated remeasurements. initially for upland plots only. For upland plots (n = 134). all woody stems > 5 cm DBH were measured to nearest 0.1 cm and mapped in polar coordinates from the plot center. Smaller stems were similarly mapped and measured in a central sub-plot 8 m in radius: in 1989 the minimum size for recording stems in the sub-plot was 3 cm; in 1992. minimum size was 2.5 cm; for all subsequent years all stems > 1 cm DBH were included. In 1989â€“1992. distances were measured using tapes and azimuth using Suunto site-through compasses; from 1993 onward. distances were measured using Sonin ultrasonic rangers. Subsequently. woody stems in upland plots have been remeasured and newly established stems mapped and measured at. generally. five-year intervals (three or four measurements for most); since 1999. these plots have been consolidated into two groups sampled at staggered intervals such that the most recent measurements are for 2004 and 2007. For some species of large shrubs (Acer spicatum. Corylus cornuta. Cornus rugosa) stems were tallied without mapping. All dead stems > ca. 20 cm (including down stems and stumps) were included in initial samples of upland plots. Dead stems were identified to species where possible. and rated on an 8-point decay scale (Table 1). and classed as standing. tipped up. or broken (with height of break recorded); DBH was measured or estimated for dead stems where possible (for decay codes of 7â€“9. diameter measurements were typically impossible). In subsequent remeasurements of upland plots. stems dying since previous measurements were similarly coded (generally using only the first two grades of the decay scale) where possible (dead smaller stems could not always be relocated); after initial plot measurements. DBH was not recorded for dead stems.Since 1994. with major efforts beginning in 2001. I have remeasured a total of 65 additional plots in wetlands on peat and muck soils. As for upland plots. all stems > 5 cm DBH were measured for the entire plot and stems from 1â€“5 cm for an 8-m radius sub-plot. but stems were not mapped in these stands.

Sampling was usually done on a biweekly schedule during the open water period and at least once through the ice at the deepest region of each lake. although in some years lakes Waubesa and Kegonsa were only sampled monthly during the open-water period. On a few dates during high winds or during winter. sampling was conducted in slightly shallower water than at the deepest lake location. Tow depths for Mendota and Monona are included in the data set. Tow depths for Waubesa and Kegonsa have not been transcribed yet. but generally ranged between 9.5-10.0 meters and 7.5-8.0 meters. respectively. The conical zooplankton net had a 15-cm diameter opening (small net) and a net filtering area to opening area ratio of about 11. The net was made of Nitex screening with a mesh size of 75-80 um (#20 net) for all years except for 1976 when the mesh size was about 153 um (#10 net). The smaller-meshed net was initially chosen so that rotifers would be quantitatively collected along with crustacean zooplankton. For the small net. a vertical tow sample was taken from approximately 0.5 m off the lake bottom. The net was pulled to the lake surface at approximately 0.3 m per sec. After the net was raised and the sides rinsed. the sample was transferred to a bottle and preserved with formalin in early years. sugared formalin for a few years. and then formalin plus seltzer water was the preservative used after 1986. For each zooplankton sample obtained by the small net. organisms were identified to species and enumerated in three separate 1-mL subsamples obtained by a Hensen-Stemple pipette. Subsamples were taken directly from the sample bottle (sample volume ca. 150-250 mL). transferred to a 1-mL Sedgewick-Rafter cell and counted using a compound microscope. For each subsample. individual body lengths for all Daphnia encountered were recorded using an eyepiece micrometer; 5-10 organisms of other cladocerans and various life stages of copepods (i.e.. nauplii. copepidites. and adults) were also measured. Based on specified size criteria. juvenile and adult Daphnia of each species were recorded separately. These size criteria were given in Luecke et al. (1990) for samples collected in 1976-1989. The criteria varied in subsequent years but were generally 1.3 mm for D. pulicaria. 1.2 mm for D. mendotae. the most common Daphnia species encountered. If smaller Daphnia were encountered with eggs in their brood chamber. then the adult size was adjusted. Thus. the distinction of adult versus juvenile Daphnia densities recorded in each sample must be viewed as only an index of the two age groups. Calanoid and cyclopoid copepodites were counted separately as two distinct groups without regard to species or life stages. All nauplii were counted as a single group with no distinction made between calanoid and cyclopoid species. All densities and length measurements in the three subsamples were then averaged for each species' life stage. Numerical density estimates (N per meter squared) for each species or zooplankton group as reported in the data set were then computed by multiplying the average subsample count by the subsampling dilution factor (i.e.. volume of sample in bottle) and then dividing by the net opening area (0.01767 meter squared). Biomass estimates for each species or zooplankton group (gram per meter squared) can then be computed using the average length (mm) recorded in the data set using length-weight relationships published in the literature. One caveat for interpreting the zooplankton data for 1976-1994 is that the net efficiency of the vertical tow net used is less than 100%. and also variable depending on the amount of algae clogging the net (Lathrop 1998). Under clear water conditions (Secchi disc greater than 8 m). the net efficiency of the small net was determined to be approximately 58%. However. net efficiency was only about 42% during a period with moderate blue-green algal densities (Secchi disc 1.8 m). The relatively small mesh size (75-80 um) of the net was initially chosen in order to capture rotifers. which are recorded in the database. Beginning in 1991 a larger 30-cm diameter (large) net with a 75-80 um mesh size was also used. which became the standard sampling net used in 1995 coincident with the lake sampling program being conducted by the North Temperate Lakes Long-Term Ecological Research (NTL-LTER) Project. After 1994. the small net was no longer used for sampling zooplankton on the Yahara lakes. This data set also contains large net data for years 1991 through 1994 for Mendota and for 1994 for Monona. Leptodora counts from the small net are available for Mendota (1976-1989). Monona (1976-1987). Kegonsa and Waubesa (1976-1985). Leptodora counts from the large net are available for Mendota (1991-1993). All Leptodora counts were performed on the entire sample by dumping the sample bottle into a container. Individual length measurements for some zooplankton sampled with the small net are available for Mendota (1988-1989. 1992-1994) and Monona (1994). Individual length measurements for zooplankton sampled with the large net are available for Mendota (1991-1993). Daphnia eggs counts (number of eggs per adult daphnia in the sample) from samples taken with the small net are included for Mendota (1976-1991). Monona (1976-1993 except 1989). and Kegonsa and Waubesa (1976-1985). Egg counts represent the combined number of free eggs found in each subsample plus eggs still remaining in adult Daphnia as many times adult Daphnia had eggs expelled from their brood chambers once the preservative was added (especially in years when the preservative was just formalin). Once the total number of eggs for either D. pulicaria or D. mendotae was counted. then the estimate of the number of eggs per adult Daphnia was calculated while recognizing that the criteria for separating adult versus juvenile Daphnia is not without error. Thus. the number of eggs per adult number is best used as an index to determine if the Daphnia population was increasing or not growing due to food limitation.

A diver swims the length of the 40 m transect approximately 1m above the bottom at a constant deliberate speed and records all fish passing through the sampling area. Fish size is measured as total length (TL) estimated to the nearest cm. Care is taken by the diver to not count the same individual more than once if it leaves and re-enters the sampling area. Surveys are carried out by only a select number of highly trained divers whose sampling techniques have been standardized in order to minimize observer bias. The horizontal visibility along the transect is measured and recorded for each sampling event. The number of fish taxa sampled is not fixed as all species of reef fish encountered in the sampling area are recorded. Species that are difficult to identify underwater are lumped into broader taxonomic categories (e.g.. flatfish in the family Bothidae) to facilitate sampling.  Several species of small bottom-dwelling fish are difficult to accurately count and size during the reef fish survey due to their cryptic appearance and behavior. Individuals in a select group of these species are counted and sized in a separate survey done in the four contiguous 20 m x 1 m swaths that centered on the 40 m transect (Figure 1). A diver carefully searches the area within each swath taking time to look on the undersides of ledges and in crevices. and within understory vegetation for select species of small cryptic fish which are purposely not counted in the reef fish survey.

UPC data are collected at 80 points uniformly positioned within a 1 m wide area centered along each 40 m transect (Figure 1). A diver records all organisms intersecting an imaginary vertical line passing through each point and species percent cover is determined as the fraction of points a species intercepts x 100. A species is only recorded once at a given point even if it intersects the imaginary line multiple times. Using this technique the percent cover of all species combined on a transect can exceed 100%. but the percent cover of any individual species cannot. Species are recorded from top- down as they are encountered and are entered from left to right on the datasheet in such a way that primary space holders occupy the left side of the â€œSP_CODEâ€ column. Species growing attached to other organisms are not counted. except those species growing on the ornate tube worm (Diopatra ornata). Additionally. the substrate type under each point is recorded and if the substrate is sand. then the depth of the sand is measured to the nearest cm. Mobile organisms occurring at a sampling point are not counted and are moved so that the species and substrate beneath them can be recorded. Only the holdfast is recorded to estimate the percent cover of the kelps Macrocystis pyrifera. Pterygophora californica. Eisenia arborea and Laminaria farlowii; the blades and stipes of these species. which extend into the water column. are ignored if they intersected a sampling point. Unlike the sampling of algal and invertebrate density done in fixed quadrats and swaths. the number of taxa sampled by UPC is not fixed; instead all sessile species encountered are recorded.

The summer RV survey follows a stratified random sampling design (Halliday and Kohler 1971). and includes both hydrographic sampling and sampling of fish and invertebrates using a bottom otter trawl.The bottom trawl survey was originally planned to provide biomass and abundance trends for groundfish residing at depths from about 50 m to 400 m. and was extended to cover depths down to 750 m in 1999.There were changes to the net used and the vessel conducting the survey in 1982 and 1983. From 1970 ? 1981 the RV A.T. Cameron. a side-trawler using the Yankee 36 trawl. was used for the survey. In 1982. the RV Lady Hammond was used. towing a Western IIA trawl. Since 1983. the Alfred Needler has been the primary survey vessel. and the Western IIA trawl has been used in all years. Conversion factors were calculated for net and vessel changes (Fanning 1985).For long-term averages. the most appropriate starting point has been selected for each species. In the case of white hake. biomass plots start in 1970 but the abundance index data only go back to 1982. For silver hake. biomass plots and abundance index data are used starting in 1982. This is in conjunction with the change in the type of trawl. from a Yankee 36 to a Western IIA. as well as more consistent identification of white hake and red hake.In 2010. additional survey tows were completed in deeper water off the shelf edge (750 ? 1.800 m) to investigate species composition and biomass in deeper waters. Catches from these stations are not included in the biomass index estimates. to ensure that comparability with other years is maintained.

These depths are considered separate biogeographic zones and since they have not been sampled in all years. are not included in the long-term biomass index estimates.Plots of the size and distribution of catches are provided for selected species and stratified average catches are compared with past results to provide a general overview of trends in abundance and biomass. For select commercial species where individual fish weights have been collected throughout most of the time series. trends in condition (Fulton?s K: weight/length3) are also included (Ricker 1975).Data are presented for the major commercial species. for species that comprise a large part of the survey catch. and for species where the 2010 catch was either unusually high or low (see also DFO 2011a).

I obtained bibliographic information from the recent database of Italian Lepidoptera (Parenzan and Porcelli 2006). When possible I used the year of collection as reported in literature instead of publication date. I also included collection data from hand netting between 1999 and 2008 and by Malaise trapping between 1999 and 2004 in several different localities of Elba (Dapporto and Cini 2007 Dapporto and Strumia 2008a b).

This collection mainly comprises specimens collected in the first 50 years of the 20th century.The relative abundance of species occurrence in source areas for Italian offshore islands (SSF) (here called source frequency) is calculated as the number of 10 Ã— 10 km squares occupied by each species within 50 km from the Italian Peninsula Sicilian. and Sardinian-Corsican coastlines (from Balletto et al. 2005 and Dapporto and Dennis 2008b). For the Elba endemic Lycaeides villai I used as SSF the proportion of 10 Ã— 10 km squares of the whole Lycaeides genera (L. argus L. idas L. bellieri L. corsicus) indeed the relationships between these species are still unclear (compare Jutzeler et al. 2003 Parenzan and Porcelli 2006).

Sampling methods:Microplankton abundanceData analysed were collected from 1992 to 2002 at 788 sites. See Fig. 1 and Table 1 for a detailed site description. Seawater samples were collected from different depths (most of them in surface waters) from CTD Niskin bottles. For later microplankton cell counts. it is very important to handle seawater with care. as some organisms are very sensitive to turbulence (Gifford and Caron 2000). Water samples were taken from the Niskin bottle and immediately preserved with 1â€“5 % acid-Lugol's iodine solution (Throndsen 1978). Samples were labelled and stored in cold. dark conditions during transportation to the laboratory.NutrientsWe only have in situ nutrients data for AMT cruises. Samples were taken from the underway pumping system between stations. from vertical profiles at each station. or both. However. we only included samples obtained during the daily CTD casts coincident with the microplankton sampling. Water samples from the CTD/Rosette system (SeaBird) were sub-sampled into clean Nalgene bottles. Sample analysis was completed within 3 h of sampling. so no samples were stored.Other variablesFor Chlorophyll. between 200 and 300 mL of sea water from each depth in the water column were sequentially filtered through 0.2 Âµm. 2 Âµm and 20 Âµm polycarbonate filters. Chl a was extracted from filters in 90% acetone at 20Â°C for 12 to 24 hours. Samples were measured on a Turner 10-AU fluorometer calibrated with pure Chl a.Temperature and PAR were obtained either from CTD data or underway records from the ship. For those stations where it was impossible to obtain data. these were retrieved from satellite data.2. AnalysisMicroplankton abundanceMicroplankton identification and cell counts was carried out by Derek S. Harbour at the Plymouth Marine Laboratory using inverted microscopy following the UtermÃ¶hl technique (UtermÃ¶hl 1958). The ''Water quality - Guidance standard for routine microscopic surveys of phytoplankton using UtermÃ¶hl technique'' (BS EN 15204:2006) was followed:Microplankton samples. preserved in Lugol's iodine and formalin. were settled in sedimentation chambers while acclimatized to room temperature. to ensure a random distribution of cells. After this. sample bottles were rotated to help re-suspension and separation. Sub-samples with volumes between 10 and 256 mL were later transferred to plankton settling chambers. A variable area of the chamber bottom was counted under the microscope. The size of that area varies with species and abundance and under some circunstances different species were counted in different settled volumes to obtain consistency and reproducibility in the counts. At least 100 cells of each of the more abundant species were counted. Settlement duration varied between 4h cm-1 for Lugol's iodine and 16 h cm-1 for formaldehyde samples.Once the settling process finished. cells were identified. where possible. to species/genus level and assigned to different functional groups: Flagellates. Heterotrophic flagellates. Diatoms. Coccolithophores. Dinoflagellates. Heterotrophic dinoflagellates. and Ciliates. It should be noted that heterotrophic refers to organisms that do not contain pigments.Abundance data for each species at each station was calculated in cells per mL. Dimensions of individual species were measured in Âµm units using digital measurements and calibrated against an ocular micrometer. Using the corresponding geometric shapes. these measurements were converted to volume using the (Kovala and Larrance 1966) methodology. Once this was done. cell volumes were converted to carbon (pg cell-1) using the formulae of Menden-Deuer and Lessard (2000).Since all the plankton counts were obtained by light inverted microscopy they do not include pico-cyanobacteria. like Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus. The database adequately samples the microplankton size range and part of the nanoplankton abundance. small eukaryotes are also too small to be identified to the species level by light-microscopy. The UtermÃ¶hl technique is restricted to cells larger than 10 Âµm (within the nanoplankton size range). Smaller cells do not settle quantitatively even after Lugol's iodine addition and cells are too small to classify to the species level.NutrientsTo analyse nutrients. a Technicon AAII (four-five channel depending on the cruise) segmented-flow auto-analyser was used. Protocols used were different for each nutrient: phosphate and silicate were analysed as described by Kirkwood (1989). Nitrate and nitrite was analysed using a modified version of Grasshoff's method (Grasshoff 1976). as described by Brewer and Riley (1965). These were measured as nirate plus nitrite. since the nitrate was determined as nitrite using a copper-cadmium reduction column to reduce it to nitrite. We later calculated nitrate as the difference between the nitrite measure and the nitrite plus nitrate measure. Ammonium was measured only in cruise AMT6. The chemical methodology used was the described by (Mantoura and Woodward 1983). All results are presented as Âµmol L-1 of the elements nitrogen. phosphorus and silica.

Until substantial poaching began in 1986. Manyara had the highest mammalian biomass density in any natural ecosystem (Delany and Happold 1979; Drent and Prins 1987). comparable to the system of Queen Elizabeth National Park. Uganda (again dominated by elephant and buffalo) before severe poaching reduced mammal numbers drastically there in the 1970s. Manyara is situated mainly in the Eastern Rift Valley (960 m above sea level) but partly on the Mbulu Plateau (1600 m a.s.l.) and receives an average of 650 mm of rain annually. Most game in the Park is sedentary but wildebeest and Burchell's zebra show extensive migratory movements into the rest of the Masai Ecosystem (Prins 1987). Estimates were obtained from a variety of sources (see Legend of Table 1) of the total number of large herbivores (heavier than 20 kg) within the present Park boundaries during the last 25 years. The species and nomenclature are present in Table 2. Where data were lacking for a particular species for a given year of census. estimates were made on the basis of figures from the previous and subsequent censuses. The obtained estimates were discussed with park rangers who had been working in the Park at the time of the missing value. Published figures (Table 1) were also discussed with these rangers. and on the basis of these and on the warden's reports (1959 through 1973). the published figures for the hippopotamus population in 1961. 1965. 1967. and 1970 were disregarded and a new estimate was used instead. It should be noted that estimates of bush species (viz. black rhinoceros. bushbuck. and to a lesser extent impala. waterbuck. and olive baboon) because of the limited visibility in their habitat. are undoubtedly less reliable than estimates for plains species (viz. Burchell's zebra. wildebeest. and to a lesser degree warthog) or for other large herbivores (African elephant. Cape buffalo. and giraffe; cf. Prins and Weyer-haeuser 1987). The estimates for reedbuck are quite reliable as the wardens paid special attention to their numbers. Consumption was calculated according to the assumption that the herbivores' daily food intake (dry matter) equals 2.5% of their live body weight (Crampton and Harris 1969; Van Soest 1982. Van Wijngaarden 1985). which compares reasonably well with the published data for food intake of East African herbivores (Delany and Happold 1979). For the calculations the average live weights used for the different species are presented in Table 2. Some of the species in Manyara are considered real grazers. others real browsers but many species are mixed feeders (Hofmann 1973). As we are interested in quantifying the consumption of grass and browse in Manyara. the consumption by species falling in the category mixed feeder had to be divided into grass consumption and browse consumption. For this division we used the data from Table 2. The data we present are gross indices of consumption per unit land in the Park. The acreage of the dry land area of the park has varied over time because of changes in the level of Lake Manyara. After periods of heavy rainfall the lake submerged parts of the grasslands and woodlands but during extended droughts the lake receded after which the surfacing shore was again colonized by grasses (Loth and Prins 1986. Prins and Loth 1988). The real land area of the Park in the different census years as calculated from aerial photographs (Loth and Prins 1986) is presented in Table 1. The pressure exerted on the vegetation by the herbivores is assumed to be equal to their consumption. although this ignores the effects of trampling. which can be quite important (cf. Sinclair and Norton-Griffiths 1979). Five groups of herbivores are distinguished in the analyses. viz. buffalo elephant-as-grazer. elephant-as-browser'. other grazers (i.e. hippopotamus. Burchell's zebra. wildebeest. impala. reedbuck. waterbuck. warthog. baboon. and bushbuck) and other browsers (i.e. giraffe. black rhinoceros. baboon. impala. bush- buck. waterbuck. reedbuck. and warthog); the categories are weighted according to body weight and the proportions grass or browse in the diet (Table 2). Mean-square successive difference testing was used to detect whether a time series was randomly distributed around the mean. or not (Wonnacott and Wonnacott 1977). The constancy parameter s. defined as the standard deviation of the base-10 logarithm of population estimates. was used to assess the stability of the population; when s is smaller than approximately 0.3 the population is considered stable (Ostfeld 1988). It is. however. better to speak of constancy (i.e.. lack of change in a numerical parameter) than of stability. as the latter implies that the population returns to a certain state after disturbance (Orians 1975). For the species assemblage we calculated a stability index. following McNaughton (1978). Thus. we defined n as the number of herbivore species (n = 13). i as the interaction term equalling the mean value of significant Spearman rank correlation coefficients (rj) between population numbers (for P<0.05 and for P< 0.01). and c the proportion of all r. values that were significant. The stability index is calculated as i/(nc) 1/2; when the stability index is < 1.0. the system is stable and when the index is > 1.0. the system is not stable. We did not calculate guild size (nc) (McNaughton 1978). as this does not appear to be a valid calculation (Harris 1979; Lawton and Ralliston 1979).â€ Large mammals census in Park in Tanzania Unit of abundance = IndCountInt, Unit of biomass = NA",Census,NA,1.

In these core fields four permanent sampling transects were laid out in each field. Fields 22 and 29 have 6 transects but these fields are not generally considered part of the core group. In addition to these core old fields. many other similar abandoned fields exist at Cedar Creek and a subset was also sampled for grasshoppers. For the purpose of the grasshopper sampling these fields have been labeled as â€œsupplementalâ€ old fields. The supplemental fields did not have permanent transects in them and grasshopper sampling methods were adjusted accordingly. Grasshoppers in 19 core E014 old fields were sampled by sweepnet mid-month from June through September from 1989-2006.  Field 28 was added in 1997 and field 11 was added in 2002. bringing the total core field count to 21. Sampling dates are summarized in Table: Core Old Fields Grasshopper Sampling. fields and dates. In each sampling period. 50 sweeps were taken with a 15-inch muslin sweep net along four 40m transects (labeled G. R. W. Y) near the center of each plot. The total number of sweeps for each field in each sample period was 200. with an annual total of 800 sweeps/field. A sweep consisted of a rapid approximately 2m-long horizontal swing of the net through the vegetation. Sweeps were generally collected between 10am-4pm during a two day period when it had not rained and weather was fair with sunny skies. modest breezes. and temperatures above 70Â°F. The contents for each transect were bagged separately in 1-gallon plastic bag. but counts in this data set are pooled by sampling period. Samples where frozen until Orthoptera could be counted and identified to genus and species (where possible). All identifications were done by John Haarstad. *Note about comparing experiments: morphological notes may not indicate the same species/group in different experiments.    -------------- Core Old Field Grasshopper Sampling: Irregularities to Note 1) Only the family Acrididae was recorded throughout the entire survey period (1989-2006). Other families were sorted and identified in all years except 1992 and 1993. 2) Two newly abandoned fields were added to the core old field survey after it began in 1989.

The survey route consisted of the same 4-km walk which took approximately four hours (1000â€“1400 h). Walking surveys is an  effective and widespread practice for monitoring amphibian and reptile communities (Doan. 2003; Woodford and Meyer. 2003). The route included normal tallgrass prairie habitats. the shorelines of a pond. and intermittent streams. Amphibians and reptiles were detected by turning over rocks and other debris. and by sighting animals in the open. Each year. we recorded the number of individuals of each species encountered. and environmental conditions including: midday air temperature (C). water temperature (C). cloud cover. burn conditions (burned versus unburned). and the presence of flowing water in the intermittent streams (Table 1).  ---- Fourteen herpetofaunal surveys were conducted during a 15-year period (1989â€“1990 and 1992â€“2003) at Bud Jan Nitschke (BJN) cattle ranch in Cowley County. Kansas (37u159 N. 96u439 W). The 650 ha ranch is located in the southern portion of the Flint Hills. and the vegetation is dominated by a matrix of perennial warm-season C4 grasses. such as big bluestem (A. gerardii). little bluestem (A. scoparius). indiangrass (S. nutans). and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). A diverse mixture of other less abundant species includes warm-season and cool-season grasses. composites. legumes. and other forbs. Woody species such as leadplant (Amorpha canescens).  buckbrush (Symphoricarpos orbiculatus). New Jersey tea (Caenothus herbaceous). and smooth sumac (Rhus glabra) are locally common (Freeman and Hulbert. 1985). Average monthly temperature ranges from a low in January (22.7 C) to a high in July (26.6 C). Average annual total precipitation ranges from .750 to 850 mm with 75% falling during a summer growing season (Marchâ€“July; Bark. 1987). One common characteristic of the region is protruding limestone outcrops on hilltops. which provide suitable habitat for several species of amphibians and reptiles. During the 15-year study. two management practices were implemented at the BJN ranch. Traditional season-long stocking (200 hundred cows with their calves. .0.6 animals/ha) was implemented the first 10 years (1989â€“1998) and pastures were burned in alternate years. Starting in 1999. the land management practice switched to intensive-early cattle stocking (approximately 650 yearlings. .1.0 animals/ha. maintained for 3 months starting in late spring) combined with annual burning.

Experimental/Sampling design: Quebrada de las Vacas is a north-south oriented valley located in Bosque Fray Jorge National Park and just inland from low coastal hills (Altos de Talinay). In 1989 we established 16 0.56 ha plots (75 × 75 m) in the Quebrada del las Vacas. These comprise the Central Grid Complex.
Plots were randomly assigned to one of four treatments (4 replicates each; see Table 1) including: (1) controls, with low (1.0 m h) 2.5 cm mesh fencing buried ca. 40 cm with 5 cm d holes at ground level to provide access by all small mammals and predators (+D +P); (2) predator exclusions, with tall (1.8 m h) 5 cm mesh fencing buried 40 cm, 1 m overhangs, and polyethylene mesh (15 cm) netting overhead, excluding predators but allowing small-mammal access (including degus; +D -P); (3) degu exclusions, with low (1.0 m h) 2.5 cm mesh fencing without holes to exclude degus but not other small mammals or predators (-D +P); or 4) degu & predator exclusions, with tall (1.8 m h) 5 cm mesh fencing, with high overhangs, and netting to exclude predators, supplemented with 2.5 cm fencing to exclude degus (-D -P). Any degus captured in -D plots during monthly censuses are removed and released approximately 1 km from the experimental grid complex. In 1997 we added 4 open grids (no fencing) for a food supplementation study (Grids 17–20; Meserve et al. 2001; this terminated in late 2002.
In 2001 in response to 12 years with no indication of substantial vegetative responses to the exclusion of degus, we converted -D -P plots to exclude all small mammals (-SM) by removing overhead netting and converting fences to lower (1.5 m) fences with finer mesh (hardware cloth, ca. 5 mm mesh) and metal flashing to prevent animals from climbing into grids. We also trimmed vegetation on the periphery to prevent animals from climbing over fences. As with degu exclusions, we remove any small mammals captured in –SM plots and release them approximately 1 km from the experimental grid complex.

Abstract: The data set covers a 16-year period (1989–2005) of monthly surveys of small mammal. The small mammal fauna is trapped every month on all experimental plots and information on each captured small mammal is contained in this file. These data have been applied to diverse population- and community-level analyses and remain useful for investigations of population dynamics, species interactions, and the relative influence of biotic and abiotic influences. Sampling is ongoing and data will be added over time.
Data Collection Period, Frequency: Small mammals are trapped for four days/month/grid (5 × 5 stations, 15-m interval, two traps/station). As noted in the Master Metadata File, degus (Octodon degus) are removed from degu exclusion plots (e.g., “-D-P” and “-D+P” treatments), and all small mammals are removed from small mammal exclusion plots (“-SM”).
Field: We have a small house on site, and our field crew lives there for nine days every month (second–tenth day of the month). They trap eight grids for four nights followed by the other eight grids for four nights (from 1997–2002 the crew added two +F grids to each 4-d cycle). Two Sherman-type live traps (9 × 11 × 30 cm) are placed at each station (hence, 50 traps per grid) and checked 2–3 times daily (morning, late afternoon, midday under hot conditions). All individual small mammals are uniquely marked with numbered ear tags or leg bands (National Band and Tag Co., Newport, Kentucky, USA), and standard data are recorded (see Table 1). Because our site experiences fog or high clouds frequently, we do not target sampling to a particular lunar phase.
Taxonomy and systematics: Taxonomy of small mammals is consistent with the third edition of Mammal Species of the World (Wilson and Reeder 2005) with the minor exception that Abrocoma bennetti is mis-spelled therein as Abrocoma bennettii (although the epithet is spelled correctly in the Index).
Project personnel: The field crew includes four technicians; over the years we have supported 27 technicians, some in excess of 10 years on the project. Additionally, the crew frequently recruits volunteers to assist with monthly surveys.
","Small mammals are trapped for four days/month/grid (5 × 5 stations, 15-m interval, two traps/station). This dataset contains treatments (-D +P) & (+D +P).",NA,"This study was re-curated for version 2 of the database. Only treatments (-D+P) & (+D+P) were kept. For treatment (-D+P), occurrences of Octodon degus were removed (this taxon may still be found but every time it was found, it was moved outside of the plot). Only one observation of the same individual animal per sampling event was kept (i.e., removed recaptures). In case of recapture, the individual weight (in grams) of an animal is the average of its observed weights in that event. Data were then left unaggregated because the dataset contains individual weights. The SAMPLE_DESC is Year_Month_Treatment_Grid, where each treatment has 4 grids in four different plots (hence grid is kept in the PLOT column). This means that all observations per grid/plot can be pooled using SAMPLE_DESC. AFE notes the occurrence of a few individuals with very large individual weights.

During 1989â€“1990 all trees ? 30 cm girth at breast height (gbh) were sampled in five northâ€“south transects 20 m wide and 180 to 370 m long covering a total area of 3.12 ha. In 1992â€“1993 additional rectangular plots were established bringing the area sampled to 5.07 ha in total. In all 3870 trees were identified tagged mapped and provided with permanent dendrometer bands. Since then the sampled area has been regularly censused at 3â€“5 year intervals recording tree recruitment mortality and growth. We present data from censuses conducted in 1990â€“1993 1994 1997â€“1998 2001â€“2002 2007 and 2010. These data have been used to study the natural forest dynamics and to calibrate spatially explicit simulation models. ____ Sampling design consists of five northâ€“south oriented transects viz. A B C D and E each 20 m wide 180 to 370 m long and 100 m apart center to center. The 5 transects were installed in 1989â€“1990 and collectively represent a 3.12-ha systematic sample of the forest compartment whose main dendrometric and floristic characteristics are given in Pascal and PÃ©lissier (1996). Subsequently additional rectangular sampling plots viz. H R and S which overlap the transects and represent an additional area of 1.95 ha were established in 1990â€“1993 to study the dynamics of the forest in particular topographic situations (PÃ©lissier 1997 1998). A piece of R source code is given in section III-V-D below to extract data according to various sampling configurations. Table 1 gives a summary of plot size and location. Because of the uneven site topography (see B.1.Watersheds and hydrology) each plot was designed as a grid of 10 Ã— 10 m contiguous elementary quadrats adjusted to account for local slope angle. The purpose of the correction was to ensure that each side of a quadrat was approximately 10 m flat so that it contains in total a 100 m2 area in planar projection. The slope angle (alpha) was measured along each quadrat sides which length parallel to the ground was adjusted to l = 10/cos(alpha). In order to accurately locate the trees in (xy) co-ordinates within each quadrat they were temporarily delineated with a plastic rope. All trees from 30 cm girth at breast height (gbh) were inventoried measured tagged mapped and identified to species. The point of girth measurement of each tree (pom) was marked with paint in the initial inventory and then fitted with a permanent dendrometer band. For mapping the trees within each quadrat the flat distance from the centre of the trunk base to the nearest quadrat boundary was measured in two perpendicular directions parallel to the rope. Each quadrat was mapped in the field at a scale of 1:100 with indication of tree locations main rocks fallen trees stream courses trails etc. These maps are stored at IFP Botany Lab. Instrumentation: Slope angles were measured with a 1-degree precision using a Suunto hand-held clinometer. Distance measurements were taken with a 1-cm precision thanks to a 20 m fiberglass tape. Initial tree girths were measured at 1.30 m from the ground or above the buttresses with a precision of 0.1 cm using a 3 or 5 m flexible steel tape. A calibrated 1.30 m stick was used to determine pom height. The dendrometer bands were prepared by technical IFP staff using stainless steel bands adjusted to tree girth and equipped with a 1:50 vernier (Hall 1944; Fig. 5) that allows girth to be measured with a theoretical precision of 0.02 cm. The dendrometers were then fitted at pom on the trees and vernier readings taken as initial gbh measurement. Recensuses. Recensuses have been conducted every 3â€“5 years in all plots since May 1990 (census 0) in May 1994 (census 1) November 1997â€“April 1998 (census 2) December 2001â€“May 2002 (census 3) April 2007 (census 4) and April 2010 (census 5). Time intervals between censuses are given in Julian day calendar since day 0 on 1st March 1990. However some plots (H extension R and S) installed in March 1992 and November 1993 are included with a census 0 date on day 762 and 1341 respectively. Similarly censuses 2 and 3 which were completed over several field trips refer to more than one Julian date (see Table 1). At each recensus all plots were screened for tree mortality tree growth by girth increments of alive trees reading from dendrometer bands and tree recruitment i.e. those trees attained the girth threshold of 30 cm gbh since the previous census. The recruited trees were tagged mapped identified and installed with a dendrometer band following the initial census protocol (see II.B.3. Research methods). Summary data of plots demography are given in Tables 3 (all plots pooled together) and 4 (tansects A to E pooled together).

This dataset is a subset from the The Australian Zooplankton Database collated by Claire Davies under Project ID 1.
Dataset Methods:
This dataset contains records for Project ID 1:	PhD; zooplankton abundance in Gulf of Carpentaria. These are data of copepods only; identified to species. The methods used to collect the data are: net type = square bongo; net diameter = 0.5m, net mesh size = 142microns & samples are from vertical depths ranging between 10 & 60 m.
General BioTIME curators note for The Australian Zooplankton Database: please be aware that spatial sampling effort might not be consistent throughout sampling events in some projects/time-series. This can be resolved with gridding and rarefaction, however we strongly recommend against using data for study-level analyses whenever spatial effort varies largely across samples.
The Australian Zooplankton Database Metadata:
[extracted from https://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E095/278/metadata.php]
-Experimental or sampling design: Data have been collected using different equipment and sampling designs. Zooplankton have been generally collected by net, although Project 597 has used a Continuous Plankton Recorder. Nets used have varying mesh sizes and we have included these where available. Data have been sourced from research cruises, student projects, published literature and time series surveys. Details of each project are described in the file zooplankton_metadata.csv. These metadata should allow users to understand how the data compare with those from other projects when analyzing across data sets.
The taxonomic resolution for each project varies according to the aims of each specific survey. This can be especially important when using the data to interpret absences. Absences can be (a) true where the analyst did not find the target taxa, or (b) not truly representative; when the taxa were not sampled for or identified at low resolution (e.g., copepod naupliar lifestages), or the analyst did not look for the particular taxa and presence or absence was not determined. The resolution to which each data set was counted is detailed in the file zooplankton_metadata.csv. We recommend that if a taxon is not mentioned within a project then a real absence should not be interpreted. If a taxon is mentioned in some samples and not others, from within the same data set, a real absence can be inferred.
-Taxonomy and systematics: All species names have been verified in the process of uploading the data. Each species name has been updated to the current accepted scientific name according to WoRMS (World Register of Marine Species). For taxa where species identifications cannot be confirmed, a higher taxonomic level has been applied. Much of the data set also includes information on gender for copepods because species identification usually necessitates determination of gender. Taxonomic sheets, which provide species identifications and distribution maps, have been published for many of the common species (mainly copepods) included here and can be found at the Australian Zooplankton Taxonomic Guide and Atlas website (Richardson et al. 2013, Swadling et al. 2013).
All data have been standardised to abundance (number per m3 of water filtered) and are therefore comparable across data sets (within the constraints of mesh size and sampling procedures). The sample depth and the water depth at the sample location have been included as fields in the data file so the user can to convert to abundance per m² using whichever depth is relevant to their requirements. This will increase the usability of the data set and improve comparability between shallow and deep tows and locations. The Australian Bathymetry and Topography, June 2009 (http://www.ga.gov.au/corporate_data/67703/Rec2009_021.pdf) and ETOPO2v2 2006 (http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/relief/ETOPO2/ETOPO2v2-2006/) were used to estimate the water depth for each sample location.
We have given the average total length of adult copepods, since copepods have determinate growth, and the body size data is easily available and accepted. The juvenile size is assumed as the smallest adult size in the range given for the adult of that species. The majority of the copepod length data has been compiled from Bradford-Grieve et al. (1999) and the marine planktonic copepod website (Razouls et al. 2005-2014). Other sources were Ruth Böttger-Schnack via personal communications for Oncaeaidae and Frost and Fleminger (1968) for Clausocalanus. Size coefficients are not given for other taxa, for which the sizes are not well known and can vary greatly depending on age (not recorded in the datasets) or environmental conditions.
Surveys pertaining only to ichthyoplankton have not been included in this data set. They potentially warrant a separate database due to the volume of data available and there is already a considerable amount of data synthesis in this field.
-Data verification: Anomalous data, with uncertain species identifications, locations on land, or data with missing values have been excluded from the data set.
Exact sampling dates were not known for some projects and had to be estimated for Projects 18, 24, 29, and 615 from information given in the associated literature. The sampling date range is given in the file zooplankton_metadata.csv. The temporal resolution of the sampling is detailed in the sample_year, sample_month, sample_day and sample_time_UTC fields of the file zooplankton_metadata.csv. Exact sampling locations were not known for some of the sampling sites in Project 615. These have been inferred from figures showing the ships track and sampling locations. These data will be adequate for use in long-term time series or mapping distribution, but care will be needed if associating these values with contemporaneous environmental variables.
-Data set usage history: Some of the included data have been used in the Australian Marine Zooplankton Taxonomic Guide and Atlas to map species distributions (Richardson et al. 2013, Swadling et al. 2013) and to provide initial comparisons of tropical copepod communities (McKinnon and Duggan 2014). Large-scale analysis of these data has not yet been undertaken, but it is hoped that the publication of this data set will facilitate further analysis. Most of the projects have been analysed for the purpose for which they were collected and published.

Surveys were conducted between 04:30 and 08:00 EDT and most were completed by 06:30 EDT. Observers listened quietly for ten minutes at each of five stations. [In 2003 we increased the 5-species point count length from five to ten minutes in order to gather more information and to achieve methodological consistency with the all-species protocols and with Canada?s High-Elevation Landbird Program.]They recorded the number of each focal species seen or heard during three time periods: 0-3 minutes 3-5 minutes and 5-10 minutes. If Bicknell?s Thrush was not detected during or between point counts surveyors returned to each point immediately after the full route survey and broadcast a one-minute recording of the bird?s vocalizations in order to elicit a response from present but silent birds. A two-minute listening period followed each broadcast. [Prior to 2003 the broadcast duration was three minutes.]Audio playbacks were discontinued upon detection of one or more individuals. If no Bicknell?s Thrush responded to the broadcasts the status of the species at that location was classified as unknown. Monitors who completed their surveys without encountering Bicknell?sThrush were asked to conduct follow-up audio playback surveys at dusk or dawn before 15 July (after Atwood et al. 1996). If no observations of Bicknell?s Thrush were made during the second visit the species was presumed to be absent from that site. Site selection was based on a GIS model of potential Bicknell?s Thrush habitat that incorporates elevation. latitude. and forest type (see Lambert et al. 2005). The model depicts conifer-dominated forests above an elevation threshold that drops 81.63 m for every one-degree increase in latitude (-81.63 m/1? latitude). The threshold?s slope corresponds closely with the latitude-elevation relationship for treeline in the Appalachian Mountain chain. which is -83 m/1? latitude (Cogbill and White 1991). Four routes have been established on peaks lying below the elevation threshold. while forty routes cross the threshold due to the limited availability of trails or land area above the threshold. We made an attempt to randomize site selection by randomly assigning priority ranks to discrete units of high-elevation habitat. However. the choice of sites was constrained by the availability of volunteers and the location of existing trails. When placing routes. we favored discrete starting points (e.g. trail junction). extensive conifer stands. and upper elevations. Volunteers establishing a route for the first time placed five points at 200- to 250-m intervals along a mapped course. Monitors submitted a detailed description of each station in order to facilitate its location in future years. 10% quinaldine solution spread throughout the study site to anesthertize fish.

Two of these collections (March and October 1979) were excluded from analyses because a combination of storms and insufficient low tides (-0.15 m) prevented adequate sampling. The remaining 13 collections were made during low tides ranging from -0.24 to -0.46 m. Sampling consisted of spreading a 10% solution of quinaldine (an anesthetic) throughout the study site until fully anesthetized fishes were observed. Specimens were then collected by hand or with dip nets and sampling was terminated after a complete search of the study site failed to yield additional specimens. This included overturning rocks and boulders by hand which were then replaced with minimal disruption. Three investigators have shown that quinaldine collections yield relatively unbiased estimates of the relative abun- dances of fishes in intertidal areas (Gibson 1967b; Grossman 1979; Yoshiyama 1981). Excluding the May 1981 sample where all specimens were identified and returned to the site alive specimens after collection were placed in 10% formalin and identified. They were later transferred to 45% isopropanol measured (standard length) and weighed on an analytic balance to the nearest 0.1 g.

(1994) was applied also during the additional seventeen years. For a recent general description and discussion of the method we refer to Bibby et al. (2000). The method is also called spot mapping? after William (1936) and it is similar to the method used in the Common Bird Census in the UK (Marchant et al. 1990) and the Breeding Bird Census in North America (Robbins 1970). The observer walks slowly through the plot putting down all bird observations in their proper positions on a map paying particular attention to recording simultaneous presence of males in adjacent territories. Species maps are then constructed from the visit map records. The species maps are used to evaluate the number of distinct clusters of records which are believed to represent territories. The method is of course prone to errors both when recording the birds in the field and when evaluating the number of territories from the species maps. Furthermore the number of territories is never stable throughout the breeding season: some birds die some fail to breed successfully and leave their territories and some arrive late and establish new territories. However for our analysis it is not essential to know the exact number of territories in every particular part of every breeding season. Instead standardization (recording birds and evaluating the species maps in the same way every year) is the key to reliable comparisons and we did our best to achieve this. We made ten visits per year in all but two years (nine visits in 2007 and 2009). They were distributed from April through June (always after 9 April and before 18 June) but with variation according to the arrival of spring. All surveys were made by the same person one of the authors (Ann Mari Thorner). Since AMT also carried out all surveys in 1987?1992 there is now a series of no less than twenty-one years with the same observer. This ensures that the new results are comparable with the data from before 1993. Each visit took between two and three hours so the minimum annual survey effort was twenty hours. A cluster of records was accepted as a territory if it contained at least three records (for a few very late arriving species two records was considered sufficient; cf. Svensson 1978). Adjacent clusters were accepted as different territories either if they were distant enough from each other (in relation to typical territory size) to make it likely that they belonged to different males or if they contained simultaneous records (a male recorded in both at the same time). A special study on inter-specific competition with a large number of nest-boxes was conducted in the valley in 1963?1966 (Enemar et al. 1972). The populations of Great Tit Blue Tit and Pied Flycatcher were artificially enhanced these years. We removed the effect of the experiment by reducing the numbers to a proportion equal to the mean proportion in the four years before and the four years after the experiment. The number of Great Tits was reduced from 9 10 19 16 pairs to 6 6 12 10 respectively. The number of Blue Tits was reduced from 6 4 7 5 pairs to 3 2 4 3 pairs. The number of Pied Flycatchers was reduced from 15 18 18 13 pairs to 4 5 5 4 pairs. These modified values are used in all calculations in this paper. Species turnover rate between two different years was calculated by dividing the total of new and lost species with the number of species in year one plus the number of species in year two. This gives the value one hundred percent (that is complete) turnover when no species are common between the two compared years. This is different from the turnover calculation by Enemar et al. (1994) where the sum of new and lost species was divided by the mean number of species in the two years. The latter method gives one hundred percent turnover when half of the species have been lost and replaced with new ones (the methods are identical in principle but give results that differ by a factor of two). In the same way we calculated turnover between two years different number of years apart (from adjacent years to a maximum of fifty-six years apart that is 1953 and 2009). Altogether forty-one small passerine species were recorded as territorial in at least one of the fifty-seven years. Eighteen of these species were keeping territories in all or almost all years (the first eighteen species in Appendix 1 also listed in 33Table 1). These eighteen species are called regular? in this paper. The final twenty-three species of Appendix 1 that is those with zero values in many or almost all years are called non-regular species. Eight of these latter species were recorded in less than four of the fifty-seven years and these species are not at all tested for population change. For the remaining fifteen non-regular and the eighteen regular species we calculated and compared the average number of territories during the first forty and the last seventeen years respectively. The difference between the two periods for the regular species was tested using a two-tailed t-test (Microsoft Excel) and the logarithms of the original values (with a small number of zeros replaced with the value 0.1 to permit calculation of logarithms). The differences for the non-regular species were tested using frequencies namely the number of years with different number of territories (i.e. with 0 1 2 3 and so forth territories). When the number of frequency classes was larger than four frequencies were pooled to form exactly four classes the same ones for both periods giving a 2?4 cell matrix. The Fisher exact test was then applied using the Vassar Stats package (home page of Vassar College Poughkeepsee NY). For the regular species we also calculated the trends across all fifty-seven years using the logarithm of abundance and standard linear regression (Microsoft Excel) also here with zeros replaced with the value 0.1. The same method was used when we calculated trends for parts of the full time series in these species. When calculating correlations between species we used the Spearman rank correlation module of STATISTICA (version 6.1; StatSoft?). All cover values are measured from the vegetation measurement frame which is 1 meter by 1 meter and partitioned into a grid of 100 10 cm by 10 cm squares. Cover is measured by counting the number of 10cm squares that are occupied by the foliage canopy of a particular plant species or by the soil disturbance leaf litter etc. Portions down to the 0.1 of a 10cm square are also measured.?

Study area macrofauna sampling and species identification - We used data from twenty-two research cruises (Table 1) from 1991 to 2011 conducted at Sta. M in the North East Pacific (Smith and Druffel 1998). To accommodate the water depth limitations of the remotely operated vehicles Tiburon and Doc Ricketts used during later collections the sampling area was relocated some 40 km between the 1991 and 2005 period (34?50?N 123?00?W c. 4100 m water depth) and the present (35?10?N 122?59?W c. 4000 m water depth; Fig. 1). Macrofauna were sampled with a free-vehicle grab respirometer (FVGR; Smith et al. 2001) a system comprised of four 413-cm2 grabs that collected the top 15 cm of the sediment column (Table 1). After recovery sediment from each grab was sieved through a 300 ?m mesh and preserved in 10% borax-buffered formalin solution. All polychaete specimens recovered from the grab samples were identified to species level using high-power microscopes (Zeiss Discovery v20 Stereo and high power Leica DM 5000 B) published identification keys and original taxonomic descriptions (e.g. Fauchald 1972 Fauchald 1977 and Fauchald and Hancock 1981). Only individuals with a head were considered in the subsequent analyses to give an objective assessment of density and diversity with respect to individual counts (Paterson et al. 2009). Of the 3800 headed-individuals 3646 could be classified to family level and 3077 to species level. Many species appeared to be undescribed and were designated as sp. A sp. B and so forth. Each family was assigned to a single functional group among those defined by Fauchald and Jumars (1979) as detailed in Laguionie-Marchais et al. (2013) and in Table 2. 2.2. Proxies of polychaete biomass and energy use rate. Of the 3077 identified specimens only 100 were complete individuals consequently a proxy of polychaete body volume was employed. The width of the first chaetiger (W1) was measured for all specimens (see Paterson et al. 2006) and cubed as a proxy for individual body mass (=W13). Proxy rates of energy use (respiration R) were then estimated for each specimen using standard mass scaling (e.g. mass3/4 Brown et al. 2004) such that proxy energy use rate R = (W13)3/4 = W12.25. Neither a proportionality coefficient nor a temperature coefficient was applied as in situ temperature was near-constant at Sta. M ( Ruhl et al. 2014).

Study area - The Porcupine Abyssal Plain is situated off the southwest coast of Ireland in the Northeast Atlantic. All the samples were collected between 1989 and 2005. Most samples were taken within a 20 nautical mile (37 km) radius of a central position for time series studies (48?50?N and 16?30?W) (Fig. 1 and Table 1). This site became known as the ?BENGAL Station? following a major European project on seabed biology and geochemistry that focussed its work there (Billett and Rice 2001). The site is now known as the Porcupine Abyssal Plain Sustained Observatory (PAP-SO). The site was chosen to be as far as possible from the influence of the continental slope to the east and the foothills of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge to the west. The aim was to reduce perturbations caused by slope-related process on the continental margin and the ocean ridge to a minimum. This allowed processes linking the sea surface to the abyssal seabed through the transfer of organic matter to be studied. The seabed depth at the sampling site ranges between 4800 and 4850 m. The site was a level area of seabed with little topographic and environmental heterogeneity. It had a strong seasonal signal in the flux of organic material (phytodetritus) (Billett et al. 1983).  2.2. Sampling - Sampling for megafauna was undertaken using a semi-balloon otter trawl (OTSB14). The wing-end spread was 8.6 m and the net height was approximately 1.5 m from the footrope to the headline. Towing speed was a nominal 0.75 ms?1. The net was constructed of a 44 mm stretch mesh in the main part a 37 mm stretch mesh in the central part and a 13 mm stretch mesh liner in the cod-end. Contact of the net with the seafloor and hence an estimate of the area fished was assessed by changes in wire tension during trawling operations. The acoustic beacon used with trawls between 1989 and 1999 to monitor performance was unavailable from 2000 onwards. We are nevertheless confident that our estimates of seafloor area fished remain consistent throughout the time series. On completion of a trawl samples were sorted into major taxonomic groups on board the ship before being fixed in 5% borax-buffered formaldehyde in seawater. The samples were transferred into 80% methylated spirit once the samples were returned to the laboratory. The samples were then sorted into finer taxonomic groups and wet weight and length was measured for each individual. Apart from sampling at the time series station in the middle of the Porcupine Abyssal Plain a number of other stations were sampled over the years to give spatial relevance (ca. 40?100 nm from PAP-SO). Specific sampling was undertaken deeper than 4800 m to the southeast east and north of the time series station (Fig. 1 Table 1). In addition advantage was taken of other trawling at abyssal depths closer to the base of the continental slope as part of science programmes conducted by the Oceanlab University of Aberdeen and the National Oceanography Centre Southampton. The samples came mainly from close to the mouth of the Porcupine Seabight (Fig. 1). This area had been sampled many times during the IOS Deep-Sea Biology Programme from 1976 to 1989 (Rice et al. 1991). Some of the larger abundant holothurians collected in the trawls namely Psychropotes longicauda O. mutabilis Pseudostichopus villosus and Paroriza prouhoi were enumerated and weighed at sea (fresh wet weight biomass) before the samples were used for other analyses in the years 1998 and 1999. Where this occurred the fresh wet weights were converted to preserved wet weight by applying a factor of 0.6 to the fresh wet weight in order to allow a comparison of wet weight biomass over the whole time series. Conand (1989) has shown that holothurians lose about 40% of their wet weight on preservation.

These transects were typically conducted seasonally but this frequency was variable due to logistical constraints. Linetransect photography was conducted using a Benthos 372 35mm film camera and Benthos 382 strobe mounted on a towed benthic camera sled at a height of 82 cm and 22.5? below horizontal (S1). The camera took photographs approximately every five s as the sled moved along the bottom at roughly 2.8 km h-1 creating a continuous image mosaic of the seafloor with overlapping frames. A semi-balloon otter trawl was towed behind the camera sled to non-quantitatively collect specimens from the line transect area. Collected specimens were then identified and used in part as a voucher collection to identify species in the line-transect photographs. The semi-balloon trawl had a 6.1 m opening and 3.8 cm stretch mesh net with a 1.3 cm mesh cod-end liner (S1). The photographs were evaluated using a Canadian grid system (S2) and the computer program DISTANCE (S3) which was based on line-transect theory (S4). The relative location of each individual along each transect was digitized. DISTANCE estimated the visibility of an object at a distance perpendicular to the centerline of the transect and provided a probability density function and effective strip width (ESW) for each species. The sum of non-overlapping distances between frames along the transect axis provided the transect length. Overlap was estimated by measuring the relative positions of a distinct object in sequential frames. The ESW was multiplied by the transect length to provide an estimation of abundance. When the abundance of any given group was below 15 individuals transect-1 an ESW from a species of similar visibility was used to estimate abundance. Detailed descriptions of the line-transect methodsapplied to the analysis of deep-sea camera sled photographs can be found in the supplemental reference materials (S5 S6).

We live-trapped nocturnal rodents twice each year (spring late summer) on trapping webs in upland prairie (GRASS) and saltbush-dominated (SHRUB) habitats. Three 3.14-ha webs were established in each habitat. Each web had 124 Sherman traps which were spaced 10-m apart on 12 100-m spokes with 30 degrees between spokes. Four traps were set in the center of the web. Traps were set for four consecutive nights in each trapping session. Traps are baited with a mix of peanut butter and oats set in the evening and checked (and closed) at dawn. We recorded sex age and weight upon first capture of all individuals. In the early years of the study individuals were batch-marked (Sharpie colored felt markers) to distinguish recaptures from new individuals providing the minimum information necessary to use distance-sampling methods to estimate density. Most nocturnal species are now usually marked with aluminum ear tags although we continue to mark very small (pocket mice) or small-eared (voles) species only with felt pens. For ear-tagged animals we distinguish new captures (N) from individuals marked during previous sessions (old O) versus those that are recaptured (R) on 2nd 3rd or 4th nights of a trapping session.

Transects were similar in topography and representative of the total plantation. Birds on each transect were censused 9 times an equal number of times by each of 3 census takers. Total number of birds detected on the 8 ha of transects were extrapolated to number per km2 to facilitate comparison with other studies. Annual censuses by the same people were conducted during May each year from plantation age 2 (1977) through plantation age 17 (1992). All birds within a 40-m lateral distance from the transect mid-line detected by sight or sound were plotted on each transect map while each census taker slowly traversed the midline of each transect (Conner and Dickson 1980). Censusing of each transect took from 12 to 20 minutes; the extra time on some plots was used for identifying and recording birds. All censusing was completed within 3 hours after sunrise. Censusing was avoided during high winds (>19 kph) or substantial rain. Neotropical migratory bird abundance and bird species diversity were calculated for all transects each year. Bird species diversity was calculated from the information theory formula (MacArthur and MacArthur 1961).

A diver swims the length of the 40 m transect approximately 1m above the bottom at a constant deliberate speed and records all fish passing through the sampling area. Fish size is measured as total length (TL) estimated to the nearest cm. Care is taken by the diver to not count the same individual more than once if it leaves and re-enters the sampling area. Surveys are carried out by only a select number of highly trained divers whose sampling techniques have been standardized in order to minimize observer bias. The horizontal visibility along the transect is measured and recorded for each sampling event. The number of fish taxa sampled is not fixed as all species of reef fish encountered in the sampling area are recorded. Species that are difficult to identify underwater are lumped into broader taxonomic categories (e.g. flatfish in the family Bothidae) to facilitate sampling. Several species of small bottom-dwelling fish are difficult to accurately count and size during the reef fish survey due to their cryptic appearance and behavior. Individuals in a select group of these species are counted and sized in a separate survey done in the four contiguous 20 m x 1 m swaths that centered on the 40 m transect (Figure 1). A diver carefully searches the area within each swath taking time to look on the undersides of ledges and in crevices and within understory vegetation for select species of small cryptic fish which are purposely not counted in the reef fish survey. Understory algae are brushed aside during the search but no organisms or boulders are physically moved. Size is recorded as total length (TL) to the nearest cm.

This method helped to detect density values close to the absolute (Tomia?oj? 1980, Verner 1985) and yield comparable results for different bird species. The accuracy of the method was checked by comparing the results of the census work with the data on bird numbers of intensively observed species (from studies involving individual marking of birds; Weso?owski 1983, 1985, Weso?owski 1987, Piotrowska & Weso?owski 1989, own unpublished data). Most species were registered with a less than 10% field error, but in the case of some other, e.g. Turdus philomelos, Coccothraustes coccothraustes, Ficedula albicollis and probably Regulus regulus, the breeding numbers could be underestimated by 20-33%, particularly, when densities are high (Tomia?oj? 1980, 2004, Tomia?oj? & Lontkowski 1989, Walankiewicz et al. 1997). Hence, some arithmetical corrections would be necessary for careful calculations of the community parameters. Yet, in order to avoid confusion, the data in the tables contain no such corrections.Every year, at least ten visits (sometimes 11-12 to compensate for adverse weather conditions or early onset of spring) were made between (5) 10 April and 25 June to each plot. The observations began before sunrise and proceeded along marked transects 100 m apart on the plots, leaving the transect for minor detours when necessary. Each time a different route across the plot was chosen. Only plot K, the richest in bird species, was subdivided into two parts of c.16 ha each and censused simultaneously by two observers, or by one observer on two consecutive mornings. In order to achieve a high inter-plot comparability, all plots were visited on a rotational basis by all 6-7 observers. Usually, one of the ten visits was performed in the evening for mapping bird species active at dusk. In order to record all singing individuals during the short-lasting activity period of birds in the evening, each (24-30 ha) plot was censused simultaneously by two to four observers. All fieldwork was conducted by experienced fieldworkers and new participants were admitted only after a period of apprenticeship (i.e. after making sure that they were able to gather field data of adequate quality).Data processing All records from field maps were assembled on individual species maps (scale 1:1000) for further evaluation. To assure maximum consistency of the evaluation rules, all estimates of cluster/territory numbers on species maps were checked by at least three experienced people. The final estimate was arrived at after negotiating the (usually minor) differences. When processing the data, it was taken into account that a higher number of double-registrations of the same individuals resulted from our relatively slow progress through the plot. While drawing the ""paper territories"" around the clusters of records, we relied mainly on the presence/absence of contemporary records which helped to avoid an apparent tendency in mobile individuals/species to form double clusters in the place of a single large territory. As a rule, three records were required as a minimum to draw a cluster, with a few exceptions in the case of late arriving, inconspicuous species (e.g. Muscicapa striata, Locustella fluviatilis), and unsuitable weather conditions during valid visits; in such cases only two records of high territorial significance were assumed to indicate the territory. Numerous located nests (especially for Sturnus vulgaris), and behavioural cues demonstrating presence of active nests (carrying nest material or food, alarm calls), were also helpful in deciding on the number of recognised clusters/territories. The territories of polygynous or bachelor males were treated as equivalent to those of monogamous pairs. Compared with the other papers, our species richness estimates may be somewhat higher, because they also included territories of large/rare bird species which were found to occur only partly within the plot boundaries (marked with â€œ0.1â€ signs in the tables).

This area was censused by the spot map method (Hall 1964) in 1947 (Stewart and Aldrich 1949). In 1948 the members of the Brooks Bird Club began a series of censuses by the spot-mapping method made in early June which have continued to the present at 5-year intervals (DeGarmo 1948 1953; Hall 1958; Hurley 1964; Koch 1968; DeGarmo and Koch 1974; Phillips 1979 1984). In 1959 a program of annual censuses by a rather different index method was begun. The method adopted has the merit of giving a satisfactory index of the number of territorial males in a minimum amount of time-one overnight trip to the area. The index method consists of traversing the length of the study area in a fairly rapid fashion tallying all the birds seen and heard during the traverse. This traverse requires about 12 min to complete. After a wait of about 3 min the area is traversed in the reverse direction. This down-and-back procedure is then repeated giving four traverses of the same route. One set of four is made during the last hour before dark (approximately 19:45-20: 45 EDT) and another set of four is made in the first hour of daylight the next morning (05: 30-06:30). After the evening counts a tentative judgment is made as to the probable number of singing males of each species on the area and at the end of the morning counts final judgment of the population is made. Counts of this nature have been made in the last 2 days of May or the first 2 days of June from 1959 through 1983. All counts through the years were made by the same observer. In the early years the index method counts were not too reliable while the method was being worked out but with added experience the later counts have been good measures of the population. In 1973 1978 and 1983 an additional index method count was made later in June to give some idea of the variation expected by this method. This comparison is given in Table 1. It is noted that most of the rarer species agree exactly but that some of the more numerous species differ by ? I male and the total population varies by ?2 males. In 1983 this variation in the Yellow-rumped Warbler and the Swainsons Thrush may have been due to the arrival of late migrants. In 1964 1968 1973 1978 and 1983 it was possible to compare the index method results with those of the more conventional spot-mapping method (see Tables 2 3 4). For species with small populations the two methods agree quite well but for the abundant species the index method appears to overestimate the population. This happens because this method makes no al- lowances for the fractions of certain territories being outside the boundaries of the study area. The difference is slight for individual species but the accumulated error in the total population is sometimes large. In 1983 when allowances were made for this effect the population estimates agreed almost exactly. The accuracy of the index method is highly sensitive to the weather. Inclement weather on the one day selected for the count can cause large errors. This is the apparent cause of the low count for 1967 made in a cold drizzle on the only 2-day period available that season. mark_recapture Unit of abundance = IndCountInt, Unit of biomass = NA",mark_recapture,NA,The species were only given in common name so I changed them to the scientfic name There was no day or month provided  FM biomass and depth given zeroes for NULL values Set biomass depth plot day and month to NA removed latlong from sample as constant,Day month set to 1,Susan Boyd,N,16-Aug,Count,NA,year

Any field experiment entails a trade-off between plot size and replication. Plot sizes of 1 ha are larger than those in many prior large-herbivore-exclusion studies and enabled us to include nine replicates of each plot type which was necessary both to sample multiple sites along the rainfall gradient and to achieve adequate statistical power. And although 1 ha is not large enough to detect all ecological effects of LMH (e.g. seed dispersal numerical responses of smaller LMH to the exclusion of larger LMH) it is adequate to document strong and consistent effects in many individual- population- and community-level responses of plants and small mammals (Goheen et al. 2013) as well as behavioral (as opposed to numerical) responses of smaller LMH to the exclusion of larger LMH (e.g. Young et al. 2005). Total exclosures exclude all large mammalian herbivores (LMH) larger than ~5 kg and ~50-cm tall but are accessible to hares and other small mammals; these exclosures use 2.4-m high fences consisting of 14 strands of wire electrically charged by solar powered batteries with a 1-m tall barrier consisting of 10-cm chain link. Mesoherbivore exclosures consist of 11 wires beginning 30-cm above the ground allowing access to only the smallest LMH (dik-dik Madoqua cavendishi and warthog Phacochoerus africanus) and excluding larger species. Megaherbivore exclosures consist of two wires 2-m above ground level and exclude only megaherbivores (elephants Loxodonta africana and giraffes Giraffa camelopardalis). Open? plots are unfenced and demarcated by a series of 1-m tall wooden posts at 10-m intervals; these plots allow access to all LMH species. On all fences a series of 1-m long wires at 2-m height extend horizontally outward from plots to deter animals that approach the barriers. In January 2009 vertical connecting wires were added to total- and mesoherbivore exclusion fences to increase security and stability. Exclosure plots are regularly inspected and maintained by project personnel. Rapid repairs are made whenever damage to the fencing is discovered. For the eight most common LMH species exclosure effectiveness ranged from 92% (for elephants) to 99% (for warthog and dik-dik; mean effectiveness for all LMH = 96%) during the first 3 years of the experiment (Goheen et al. 2013). Herdsmen for Mpala?s cattle-ranching operation are asked to keep cattle out of the plots. Within each plot a 0.36-ha grid (60 ? 60 m) marked by 49 rebar stakes at 10 m intervals provides a spatial template for much of the experimental monitoring. Small mammals were live trapped at two-month intervals in total-exclusion and open plots using Sherman live-traps (Goheen et al. 2013). In each trapping session and for four consecutive days a single trap was set at each of the 49 grid stakes in the center of each plot opened in the late afternoon and checked and closed in the early morning. All species of small mammals were fit with two fingerling ear tags with the exceptions of individuals in the genera Acomys Crocidura and Mus. These genera are too small or too fragile (Seifert et al. 2012) for ear tags; we instead marked individuals in these genera with black marker for subsequent identification within trapping sessions.

A total of eight survey sites have been set up across the country, with annual surveys conducted continuously every fiscal year and five-yearly surveys conducted once every five years. 2. Annual survey description: Two to three survey areas are set up at eight survey sites across the country. In each area, square frames (five locations) are set up at two to three survey points, and a quantitative biosurvey (2mm sieve) is conducted to record the benthos that appear within the square frames (benthos: epifauna, infauna 2mm or larger). In addition, a qualitative biosurvey is conducted to record the benthos that appear around each survey point. 3. Annual Survey Overview: Since the 2008 fiscal year, surveys have been conducted once a year; The survey period is generally set between April and June; In the 2008 fiscal year, trials were conducted at the Akkeshi, Matsukawaura, Banzu tidal flat, Nanki Tanabe, Nakatsu tidal flat, Nagura tidal flat, and Ishigaki Kawahira Bay sites; The Shio River tidal flat survey began in the 2009 fiscal year; As of the 2021 fiscal year, there are 8 sites for the tidal flat survey; Both quantitative and qualitative surveys are conducted; Each site is divided into 1 to 3 areas (A, B, C), and within each area, 2 to 3 survey points are set (upper intertidal zone: U, middle intertidal zone: M, lower intertidal zone: L); At each site, a quantitative survey is conducted to observe changes in biomass, and a qualitative survey is conducted to assess the diversity of species within the site. 4. Number of Benthos Individuals Appearing within the Square Frame and Associated Data (Biological Quantitative Survey (2mm sieve)). At each survey point, five 50 cm square frames are randomly placed to record the epibenthic animals. Then, a 15 cm diameter core sampler (to a depth of 20 cm) is used to collect the organisms along with the sediment. The extracted organisms are then passed through a 2 mm sieve, and the infaunal species are recorded. Epibenthic animals are recorded as the number of individuals appearing within 0.25 m² (50 cm square frame), while infaunal animals are recorded as the number of individuals appearing within 0.0177 m² (15 cm diameter core).

In addition in areas where freshwater of shorebirds is to try to concentrate also performs monitoring of paddy fields and agricultural arable land.? (?) Survey number of times: Based on the record of 10 surveys of the past to the Ministry of the Environment shorebirds population fluctuation monitoring survey conducted in the (1999 to 2002) site type has been selected by the following criteria: In the core site species in order to grasp the maximum number of each time more accurately perform three or more times per survey period. In other general site but three or more of research is desirable if difficult it may be a one-time survey. Selection criteria of core site 1 - Ramsar wetlands in the registration or the East Asia and Australia that are participating in the regional shorebirds important habitat network. 2 - that you meet the Ramsar criteria (Appendix ?). 3 - East Asia and Australia that the entry criteria of local shorebirds important habitat network is more than more meets. 4 - countries designated wildlife sanctuary or that has been designated as an important wetland 500. 5- is that track record that provided the data to the investigation of the national level.

Therefore in an environment where a tide such as tidal flats estuaries band investigation time is not matter whether it is at the time or low tide is at high tide.Aggregation of simultaneous investigation: The survey was conducted before and after 1 week (15 days) of simultaneous survey date and simultaneous investigation. Simultaneous investigation other than the survey date set to the time a lot of number of individuals in the study period.

The preliminary list of vertebrate species from Bold Park has already been published (How & Dell 1990). This herpetofaunal survey of Bold Park was undertaken between December 1986 and June 1993 using four similar fenced pitfall traplines. The fenced pitfall traplines consisted of six pitfall traps placed in a linebetween 7 and 8 metres apart. Each pit trap consisted of a 17.5 cm diameter PVC pipe that was 60 cm deep and sealed at the bottom with fly-screen mesh. Drift fences that were 50 m long fly-screen mesh 30 cm high and dug 5 cm into the substrate crossed each of the 6 pitfall traps. Each pitfall trap open for 24 hours was referred to as a pit-day. The four habitats selected for surveying represent the principal vegetation types and most of the vegetational heterogeneity of Bold Park determined by Keighery et al. (1990). These habitats were; ? BP1 Mixed coastal heath ? BP2 Dryandra sessilis shrubland ? BP3 Banksia attenuata / B. menziesii low woodland ? BP4 Eucalyptus gomphocephala (Tuart) woodland.

The surveys were conducted on 66 established sites in the 10000 hectares managed by the Boulder Open Space Department (Bock and Bock 1994). These protected grassland sites are located in a green belt which surrounds the city of Boulder Colorado and include relictual tallgrass prairie lowland hayfields in floodplains and short- and mixed-grass prairies adjacent to foothill woodlands (Bock et al. 1995). These sites should remain free of development in the coming years providing a stable study area ideal for long-term monitoring. The data were used to analyze the effects of habitat characteristics and landscape context on grassland butterfly diversity and abundance (Collinge et al. 2003). The data set represents 7246 individuals of 58 butterfly species in 5 families. These data correspond to a majority of Boulder County grassland butterfly diversity and reflect the phenology of these species for the summer months of the two years sampled (A complete list of all butterfly species found in Boulder County can be found at the USGS Butterflies of North America web site [Opler et al. 1995]). The data set includes endangered butterfly species as well as surveys from rare habitat types (tallgrass prairie). These data are presented with the hope that they improve our understanding of large scale determinants of local and global abundances and diversity. Although these data alone do not constitute a long-term data set (2 years) and the temporal scale is slightly coarse (monthly) by using the standard sampling techniques presented here researchers may generate additional fine-scale (weekly) data to constitute a long-term data set. - Field/Laboratory: In brief we surveyed 66 sites in Boulder County Open Space Grasslands five times over two years: twice in 1999 (July and August) and three times in 2000 (June July August). Sites were sampled on sunny days between 1000 and 1600 hours. We used a modified line-transect method (Pollard 1977) to survey a 200-m-diameter circle (Collinge et al 2003). Each plot was divided into four quadrants of equal area and each quadrant was surveyed for 10 minutes by a trained observer. Beginning 20 paces from the center of the plot an observer walked over the entire area of the quadrant for 10 minutes. The first three to five individuals of each butterfly species observed were collected with butterfly nets and stored in glassine envelopes for the voucher collection. Individuals that could not be immediately identified were collected and identified at the Entomology Collection of the University of Colorado Museum. All butterfly species and their absolute abundance were recorded. Voucher specimens were deposited in the Entomology Collection of the University of Colorado Museum.

Site selection and evaluation: We used a design that allowed for an equal distribution of sampling locations. Spatially-balanced sampling approaches have recently been developed (e.g. Stevens and Olsen 2004 Olsen et al. 2012) that incorporate similar characteristics as random or systematic ones but also guarantee that all samples are evenly distributed across the entire sampling frame (rather than clumping commonly associated with random sampling or distinct intervals associated with systematic sampling). Sites were chosen from Floridas Statewide Seagrass polygon Geographic Information System (GIS) data set compiled by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission-Fish and Wildlife Research Institute Center for Spatial Analysis (FWRI 2007).  We used an Albers Equal Area projection for the shapefile. The file which includes all seagrass coverage across the state of Florida was clipped to include only the Big Bend region from the St. Marks River in the north and the Anclote River in the south. From the clipped polygon we then chose sites using the spsurvey package (Kincaid et al. 2008) in the R software environment (R Development Core Team 2008). We choose a target of100 sites per sampling season (example R code for 2009 site selection provided in BBSG_2009-2010_site_selection_code_2009.txt; see Class V.C.). However because we anticipated that sampling could not be conducted at some sites (e.g. due to lack of target habitat logistical constraints) we also chose additional oversampling sites to replace target sites that had to be dropped from the initial sample. Based on pilot trials conducted in the northern region of our study area during the summer of 2008 we chose a 23% oversample for our 2009 season (100 target + 23 oversample). Based on the 2009 sampling season we chose a 27% oversample in 2010 (100 target + 27 oversample). Ideally sampling would proceed by first visiting all target sites then visiting the required number of oversampled sites to meet the target sample size. However this two-step approach was not possible in the current study given the large area over which sites were located. We therefore visited all oversampled sites as we visited target ones (i.e. we did not back track). Fourteen of the 123 sites that were drawn in 2009 and nine of the 127 sites from 2010 were dropped due to navigational hazards; typically this meant the site was located in a channel used by other boaters was located in extremely shallow water that we were unable to access or trawl or there was a physical barrier such as an oyster bar or shoal that precluded access. The remaining 109 sites from 2009 and 118 sites from 2010 were evaluated for suitable habitat to conduct sampling.Once we arrived at a site we determined whether it could be sampled based on two criteria: (1) it had to include ? 10% seagrass cover and (2) there were no hazards present to the trawl (e.g. due to presence of rocks or other hard substrate) the research vessel or researchers (e.g. due to navigational hazards such as extremely shallow water) or other boaters (e.g. due to presence of other boats anchored or heavy boat traffic). If the site did not meet both criteria we began piloting the research vessel in a spiraling manner around the site location to determine if there was suitable habitat nearby. We continued the spiraling until we had traveled 250 m from the original site (i.e. 500 m diameter circle 196350 m? area around site). If no suitable habitat was found we dropped the site and noted the reason. Among the sites evaluated 91 of the 109 in 2009 and 79 of the 118 in 2010 met the two criteria. The primary reason for a site not meeting both criteria was that it had less than 10% seagrass cover (usually with no seagrass) often with other floral (e.g. attached macroalgae) faunal (e.g. octocorals sponges) or geological characteristics (e.g. rocky reefs) that may have been incorrectly interpreted as seagrass from the aerial photos used to inform the GIS shapefile.B.2. Faunal data collection: If suitable habitat was found either at the site or from our spiraling search we sampled it using beam trawls (mouth opening: 1.87 meter (m) wide by 0.40 m tall; bag dimensions: 19 mm mesh with 3 mm mesh liner) towed on both sides of a 6.1 m research vessel (Fig. 2). Beam trawls were the most appropriate gear for our study for several reasons. First water depths in the region exceeded 5 m at some sites precluding the use of seine nets and drop traps that are commonly used in shallow seagrass beds (Edgar et al. 2001). Additionally we sought to sample across a large area within each site thus requiring a towed trawl gear. Beam trawls are advantageous over otter trawls (which is a commonly used towed gear in seagrass systems) because they retain a constant sampling volume during tows both across sites (otter trawl sampling volume can be affected by bottom substrate which varies across the study region) and within them (otter trawl sampling volume decreases as the net fills because the doors are pulled inward) (Rozas and Minello 1997 Stallings et al. 2014a). Higher and less variable capture efficiencies in beam trawls have also been attributed to the fixed mouth opening (Kuipers et al. 1992). Indeed Zimmerman et al. (1986) demonstrated that beam trawls had markedly higher capture efficiencies of penaeid shrimp (a common seagrass fauna) than seines and otter trawls. Additionally otter trawls tend to ride on top of submerged aquatic vegetation allowing animals to escape underneath the net resulting in low capture efficiency (Leber and Greening 1986 Stallings et al. 2014a). Conversely we demonstrated in pilot trials that the beam trawls remained in contact with the seafloor while being towed at varying depths on different substrates (e.g. soft sand compacted sand) and in different seagrass compositions and areal coverage. We towed the trawls from the sides of the boat (instead of astern) to eliminate problems with prop-wash on catch rates in shallow water. The trawls were towed for 2.5 minutes at a standard rate of 1.8?2.0 km/h (ca. 85 m). This tow speed (based on direct underwater observation) was determined to be the most efficient; faster tows caused the net to ride off the bottom and slower tows allowed animals to escape (personal observation during gear trials). The towing direction was determined a priori with a random number generator from 1-360 (i.e. the heading direction in degrees). However the trawl gears operate most efficiently and safely (i.e. avoiding contact with boat motor propeller) when towed downwind so we adjusted accordingly. The locations of the start and end of each tow were marked in decimal degrees using a Global Positioning System (GPS) which allowed us to measure tow distance and calculate the area sampled.All captured animals were identified to the lowest possible taxon and most were counted and measured in size classes. We did not count or measure the sizes of colonial fauna (e.g. ectoprocts ascidians) the tests of tube worms (e.g. sabellariids) or the shells of worm snails (e.g. vermetids) but we noted their presence. Among the major groups of fauna observed we were able to identify 93.4% of the taxa to species for actinopterygian fishes (92 taxa) 85.2% for bivalves (34 taxa) 85.0% for echinoderms (20 taxa) 76.8% for gastropods (95 taxa) and 70.1% for arthropods (87 taxa). Due to the large quantity of animals that had to be measured we used size classes to expedite the process. Based on previous research using trawl gears in seagrass beds (e.g. Stallings et al. 2010) we used six size classes for the current study: (1) 1-25 mm (2) 26-50 mm (3) 51-75 mm (4) 76-100 mm (5) 101-150 mm (6) ? 151 mm. We measured the total length for teleosts carapace width for crabs post-orbital head length for shrimp diameter for echinoderms and longest plane for molluscs. Once animals were identified counted and measured they were then released back into the water. Care was taken to minimize harm to the animals. Some animals were retained to allow for identification in the laboratory where microscopes and detailed taxonomic keys were present (keys used: Schultz 1969 Morris 1973 Hoese and Moore 1977 Lindner 1978 Abbott et al. 1985 Abele and Kim 1986 Robbins et al. 1986 Kaplan 1988 Littler 1989 Kensley and Schotte 1989 Humann and DeLoach 1992 Humann and DeLoach 1994 Abbott et al. 1995 Hendler 1995 Hoese and Moore 1998 McEachran and Fechhelm 1998 Voss 2002 Pomory 2007 Mikkelsen and Bieler 2008; supplemental online resources used: http://www.algaebase.org/ http://www.fishbase.org/ http://www.gastropods.com/ http://www.itis.gov/ http://www.jaxshells.org/ http://www.marinespecies.org/ http://www.sealifebase.org/ ).In addition to fauna the catch in trawl nets often included seagrass blades and drift algae. It was important to remove animals that were attached to the seagrass and entrained in the drift algae. During the 2009 field season we did this by vigorously rinsing all plant materials in 19 liter buckets filled with seawater. The seawater was then drained through a 0.5 mm wire sieve and remaining materials which were mostly fauna mixed with sediments and plant debris were placed in a plastic bag labeled with site location. The sample was frozen and animals were identified and measured in the laboratory.The seawater rinse did well to remove most animals attached to the plant materials. This was readily confirmed by visual inspection of seagrass blades where no animals remained attached after the rinse. However we were concerned at the end of the 2009 field season that a more careful approach was needed to accurately count the number of very small arthropods and molluscs commonly associated with the drift algae. We therefore slightly altered our protocols to separate fauna from drift algae for the 2010 field season. We continued to use a vigorous seawater rinse of seagrass blades in 2010. For the drift algae we would first separate all large fauna (e.g. most fishes large crabs) leaving only the smallest arthropods and molluscs. The total volume of the drift algae captured was then measured using a calibrated 19 liter bucket. In 2009 the median volume of drift algae per tow was 15142 mL. In 2010 we collected a 3785 mL subsample of drift algae which was approximately 25% of this median value. The 3785 mL subsample was taken by haphazardly grabbing small clumps from the algae collected in the trawl. We used this haphazard selection to avoid subsampling a single small section of the algae. The entire subsample was bagged labeled frozen and taken back to the laboratory. In the laboratory the algae was first vigorously rinsed in 19 liter buckets containing seawater and remaining sample sieved as was done during the 2009 field season. The rinsed algae was then carefully inspected for the presence of remaining fauna. As suspected small arthropods and molluscs remained entrained in the algae. These animals were meticulously removed by picking each individual with forceps. Animals were then identified counted and measured. Site abundances for these subsampled animals were calculated as the number of animals counted multiplied by the percent of subsampled algae (total volume of captured drift algae / volume of subsampled drift algae).

Sampling was done primarily between the hours of 14:00 and 20:00 (during the austral summer. the illuminated period is 24 h/day) by either peristaltic pump or Kemmerer bottle. Samples were collected in 1 l bottles and preserved immediately with Lugon's solution (American Public Health Association. 1985). Identification and counts were made with an inverted microscope by the method of Utermohl (1958). At least 100 individuals of the most numerous algae were counted per sample at 100x magnification. The total number of individuals counted was dependent on the number of taxa. but ranged between 200 and 500. Counting error ranged between 13 and 26%. depending on species. Algal species identifications were made using Geitler (1932). Seaburg et al. (1979) and Prescott (1962). Cell volumes were estimated for dominant taxa by measuring cell dimensions of 50-100 individuals and using closest geometric formulas of additional dates and depths to determine changes in cell volume over time. For rare taxa. volume estimates were made from fewer cell measurements.Primary productivity was measured using the method of Strickland and Parsons (1972). In situ 24 h incubations were made in triplicate 300 ml light and duplicate 300 ml dark bottles with Na14CO3 (3 uCi per 300 ml. New England Nuclear). Following 24 h incubation. samples were well shaken and filtered through Whatman GF/F filters in the dark. The filters were placed in scintillation vials and acidified with 1 ml of 5% acetic acid in methanol to remove [C14 carbonates. The [C14] fixed by biological activity was determined in Aquasol (New England Nuclear) by liquid scintillation.Samples for nitrate and orthophosphate were frozen within several hours of collection. later filtered through 0.45 um Nucleopore filters and analyzed by air-segmented continuous-flow absorption spectrophotometry (Alpkem RFA-300) (Antweiler et al.. 1993).

Near the mouth of the Irkut has an open swampy floodplain, is highly productive and represents a ""splinter"" of tertiary relict steppes of the Mongolian type, greatly transformed human activity
Century (Peshkov 1972). The main complex floodplain vegetation here can distinguish waterlogged melkokochkovatye -zlakovye forb meadows, melkokochkovatye dry meadows, eutrophic lakes and the old gravel pits at different stages of overgrowth. The main type of coastal vegetation - macrophytes association with the dominance of broadleaf cattail Typha latifolia, by forming depressions and shallow waters mezhoz?rnym solid lining. In addition, there are Typha angustifolia and T. angustifolia Laxman T. laxmannii. Reed Phragmites australis grows separate clumps up to several tens of square meters in the shallow coastal waters and careers. Floodplain terraces are occupied by steppe vegetation. Dense floodplain willow (ur?ma) are located along the river and depressions extending from radially (zamytye overgrown and ducts). On the meadows there are only a few willow bushes. For plant associations characteristic of Moza, I confirm the identity to warrant a variety of habitats (Melnikov, 1995; Melnikov et al 1988, 1997a;. Lyakhov et al 1996;. Ryabtsev, Fefelov 1997).
Near the mouth of the Irkut - one of the most developed in the Baikal region, located within a large industrial center, the city of Irkutsk. The lower portion of the flood plain crossed by several railway, highways and dirt roads and numerous trails. On steep slopes and high iron and highways were formed complexes ruderal vegetation. Along the trails, and the lower portions of slopes among the vegetation is dominated by a crescent lucerne Medicago falcata, white sweet clover Melilotus albus and notched M. dentatus. The same type of vegetation characteristic of the excavation dumps along the pits, but is dominated by blue-gray Mari Chenopodium glaucum and white Ch. album. High and dense thickets provide a protective environment for nesting birds, especially waterfowl.
Bund rail and highways understand smashed into several relatively isolated areas. Career filled with water and a thicket of broad-leaved cattails, reeds, and in places with reeds Scirpus lacustris. Sharply limit the flow of water, causing waterlogging depressions, and the formation of large overgrown with cattails pl?sov. Transient complete flooding of the floodplain is extremely rare, only in years with snowfalls in winters and happy spring, and in wet years with a sharp rise of water in Irkut. During the period of our work was a gradual draining of the floodplain and the formation of a more xerophilous, ostepn?nnyh meadows.

Diurnal samples were taken in triplicate at low spring tides with the chincha a traditionally used purse-seine-type net of the region (Nobre et al. 1915) and with 2.5 m fixed-frame-opening trawl in a 1.5-min tow. The area enclosed by the chincha was approximately 1500 m s at all stations except at VAG where it was 800 m s due to the narrow topographic configuration. Fishes were preserved by freezing. At the laboratory each specimen was identified according to the taxonomic keys of Whitehead et al. (1986) measured (total length) and weighed. The abundance biomass and species richness of the ichthyofauna were determined by sampling station. Fish were collected monthly from December 1996 to November 1997 at nine selected stations (Fig. 1) near the mouth of the lagoon (BAR GAF and SJA) at the edges of the main channels (ARE CAR and VAG) in the main freshwater area highly organically enriched (RIO) in the area showing the highest levels of industrial pollution (LAR) and approximately in the middle of the longest channel (TOR).

Stretched mesh sizes in the chincha were 19 mm at the wings 17 mm at the cod mouth 16 mm at the cod sleeve and 10 mm at the cod-end piece. Abiotic parameters (temperature and dissolved oxygen) were recorded with an oxygen meter (CONSORT Z621) salinity was recorded with a refractometer (ATAGO) and water transparency was estimated based on turbidity and Secchi depth according to Yanez-Arancibia et al. 1983 (in Rebelo 1992). Fishes were preserved by freezing. At the laboratory each specimen was identified according to the taxonomic keys of Bauchot and Pras (1987) and  Whitehead et al.

Fish were sampled monthly between November 1998 and November 2000 with a chincha a traditional beach-seine net. At each site and month three replicate samples were taken at low tide during the 5 days of the new moon at adjacent non-overlapping areas at nine sites.

Although these reefs are fished, the physical isolation of the island means that they receive less impact from human activities than most reefs in Southern California, making San Nicolas an ideal place to evaluate alternative theories about the dynamics of these communities. Here we present monitoring data from seven sampling stations surrounding the island, including data on fish, invertebrate and algal abundance. These data are unusual among subtidal monitoring datasets in that they combine relatively frequent sampling (twice per year) with an exceptionally long time series (since 1980). Other outstanding qualities of the dataset are the high taxonomic resolution captured and the monitoring of permanent quadrats and swaths where the history of the community structure at specific locations has been recorded through time. Finally, the data span a period that includes two of the strongest ENSO events on record, a major shift in the Pacific decadal oscillation and the reintroduction of sea otters to the island in 1987 after at least 150 years of absence. These events provide opportunities to evaluate the effects of bottom up forcing, top down control and physical disturbance on shallow rocky reef communities.do not include references in the abstract.

In particular, fire may increase grass and forb production while hindering shrub encroachment. Therefore, prescribed fires are a common management tool for maintaining grassland habitats in the southwest. However, Bouteloua eriopoda (black grama), a dominant species in Chihuahuan Desert grassland, is highly susceptible to fire resulting in death followed by slow recovery rates. A prescribed fire on the Sevilleta National Wildlife refuge in central New Mexico in 2003 provided the opportunity to study the effects of infrequent fires on vegetation in this region. This study was conducted along a transition zone where creosote bushes (Larrea tridentata) are encroaching on a black grama grassland. Before and after the fire, above ground plant productivity and composition were monitored from 2003 to present. Following the prescribed fire, there were fewer individual grass clumps and less above ground grass cover in burned areas compared to unburned areas. This decrease in productivity was primarily from a loss of B. eriopoda. Specifically, B. eriopoda density and cover were significantly lower following the fire with a slow recovery rate in the five years following the fire. Other grasses showed no such adverse response to burning.

a. Design characteristics: 44 permanent quadrats were located in 6 different pasture units.
b. Permanent plots: We have not been able to relocate the original quadrats because of a lack of permanent markers.
c. Data collection: Quadrats were mapped annually from 1932 to 1945, with some exceptions (see the quadrat sampling schedule data file in IV). Quadrats were mapped in the late spring-early summer growing season each year (generally between late May and July).
Research Methods 
a. Field / laboratory: The data were collected in the field using pantographs (Hill 1920), a mechanical device used to make scale drawings. The original paper maps were first scanned and then stored as TIFF image files. These images were then converted into shapefiles by heads-up digitization in ArcGIS. For a complete digitization protocol, contact Peter Adler. Daily climate data were obtained from the Miles City airport, Wiley Field (800 m a.s.l., 46°26’N, 105°53’W) located 9 km north of the study site. For the period beginning in 1933, these data are available on-line from the National Climate Data Center at www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwDI~StnSrch~StnID~20012408.
b. Instrumentation: Pantographs, scanners, and computers running ArcGIS, Python, and R.
c. Taxonomy and systematics: Originally assigned plant names were corrected for synonyms based on the USDA Plants Database (http://plants.usda.gov/). We recorded these name changes in the species_name_changes.csv file.

The position of the individual singing males were plotted on a gridded census map and great care was taken in mapping simultaneously singing neighbours.  In addition, other territorial behaviour such as courtship feeding, nest building behaviour and copulation was used to delimit the individual territories.  Considerable time was spent in searching for nests.  Mapping of colourringed individuals was also used to determine the number of territories involved.  Each year 13 - 20 census visits were made of which about two thirds took place during the mornings.  Each visit lasted about 5 to 5.5 hours and was started alternatively from the eastern and western parts of the area.  the census work was coarried out from the last week of May to the end of June.  Data were analysed using Mann-Whitney U-tests Spearman rank correlation (rn where the subscript n denotes df).  All tests were two tailed.

The height of the top species was recorded relative to the ground at that location. The grids were spaced 7 cm apart and started at 3.5 cm from the edge of the square 70 cm frame. The top species was recorded at each location and the species at the ground surface was recorded if it was different from the top species. Occasionally it was difficult to distinguish which species was on the ground because there were several intertwined individuals, therefore preference was given to vascular plants, then lichens, and then mosses. Due to the limitations of field identification many species were lumped into larger taxa.

The taxa provide are relatively robust, however even with the species lumping presented there may have been some difficulty with bryophytes and lichens.

Permanent plots for long-temer monitoring of vegetation were set up in pastures in the lowlands and highlands of Iceland in 1997-1998. The plots were resampled in 2005. Analysis of the data showed that a considerable improvement in pasture condition had in general occurred. Grazing pressure had declined, sward height increased, extent of bare ground declined, cover of vascular plants increased and cover of crytogams declined. Overall vegetation change was from a heathland towards a grassland. The vegetation change was related to declining livestock numbers and grazing pressure, but not the less to a warming climatic trend during the period.

These surveys took place onboard trawlers fishing the Israeli continental shelf, between latitudes 31º20’ N and 33º05’ N. Depths ranged between 15 and 300 m. The gross, discarded and landed catch weights were estimated for 173 out of the 324 hauls in which two or more of these variables were recorded, and therefore total catch analysis was possible. A sample of ca. 5% of the biomass (2.7-12.5 kg with a mean of 5.5±2.4 kg per haul) was extracted from each haul. While this partial-sampling method may miss rare species, it allows nearly all the fauna in the nets to be properly sampled and the time-consuming length measurements to be carried out onboard. Fish were taxonomically identified to species level, except for several cases in which only the genus was noted. Fish Total Length (TL), cephalopod Mantle Length (ML) and crustacean Carapace Length (CL for crabs, eye to telson length for shrimps) were measured to the closest 0.5 cm interval. The discard lengths defined in the present study are described in Table 1 and were subsequently used to differentiate between the two discarded fractions: non-commercial species and juveniles of commercial species. These lengths were determined empirically, i.e. they were estimated based on observations of onboard sorting practices, fishermen’s experience and minimum landing size (MLS),rather than on the actual onboard sorting of specimens, which may vary considerably due to factors such asseason, abundance, and market considerations (Machiaset al., 2001, Demestre et al., 2008). The catch sampling protocol from 1990 to 1994 was repeated in 2008–2011. A representative sub-sample from the total catch was obtained from the fish pile onboard with no specific preference given to any direction on deck to assure randomness. All fishes in samples were taxonomically identified to the species level and measured to the nearest 0.5 cm. 1990–1994 data were collected by several surveyors, and hauls with a clear lower taxonomic resolution were subsequently omitted from the database.

Historical and modern catch data of Israeli trawlers were used to evaluate trends in abundance, biomass, diversity and TrL of Levantine fishes, and assess potential interactions between invasive and indigenous species. Historical data were collected from 267 trawl hauls from April 1990 to December 1994 at depths of 15–300 m. Current data were collected in 183 hauls conducted between October 2008 and March 2011, covering the same fishing fields and depth range (15–300 m) on the continental shelf and upper slope.

For each site, we assessed vegetation structure (local-scale variable) and, for five focal scales, quantified habitat amount and four landscape configuration metrics. Each sampling site was visited eight times over a 2-year period, between August 2011 and June 2013. Bats were captured using 14 ground-level mist nets (12 9 2.5 m, 16 mm mesh, ECOTONE, Poland) in CF and fragment interiors, and seven ground-level mist nets at the edge and matrix sites. Mist nets were deployed along existing trails which are known to be used by Neotropical bats as commuting flyways (Palmeirim and Etheridge 1985). At edge sites, these trails ran parallel to the border between primary forest and secondary regrowth. In our study area mist netting efficiency was found to be highest in the first few hours after sunset (Bernard 2002). Sampling therefore started at dusk and was performed for 6 h during which nets were visited at intervals of*20 min. Mist netting at the same location for consecutive days can lead to diminishing capture efficiency over time (Marques et al. 2013). Such net-shyness related bias was avoided by spacing visits to the same site 3–4 weeks apart. Species were identified following Gardner (2007) and Lim and Engstrom (2010), and taxonomy follows Gardner (2007). Most adult bats were marked with individually numbered ball-chain necklaces (frugivores and Pteronotus parnellii) or subcutaneous transponders (gleaning animalivores). We restricted analyses to phyllostomids and P. parnellii, since all other species in Neotropical bat assemblages are known to be inadequately sampled with mist-nets (Kalko 1998).

Due to the high numbers of waterbirds at the two lakes, they were selected for counting as a part of the African Waterfowl Census coordinated by Wetlands International. There was particular emphasis on undertaking counts in January and July (to a lesser extent April and October) and the collected data were used to determine if the sites were of national and international importance (Dodman and Diagana 2003). Total counts were made for the two lakes during the period 1993–2003, in order to obtain an unbiased estimate of abundance. All waterbirds (including Ciconiiformes, Gruiformes, Charadriiformes, Anseriformes and Coraciiformes) as well as Osprey Pandion haliaetus and African Fish Eagle Haliaeetus vocifer (both of the order Falconiformes – a non-waterbird order) were counted from a canoe by two people. All birds in the water or on the shoreline and its vicinity were counted and recorded. The count periods covered all the seasons occurring in Zimbabwe: hot/wet (January), warm/moderately wet (April), cold/dry (July) and hot/dry (October). For Lake Chivero, all counts had 100% coverage, whereas coverage for Lake Manyame varied between 25% and 100%. Consequently, in the analysis, all Lake Manyame data were scaled down to represent 25% coverage, and all results are presented as such. The disparity in the counting intensity between the two lakes made comparisons of abundance between the two lakes difficult. The most extensive data were collected in the period 1993–1994 (inclusive) for both lakes, and less frequent counts occurred mostly from 1997–2003, when counts were mainly limited to January and July. Counts were mostly done for birds on the lakeshore and its vicinity, ""and birds further into the water bodies were likely missed. Such birds include flightless moulting ducks that tend to congregate in the middle of large water bodies during the day and go offshore to feed at night (Swanepoel et al. 2006). Counting during the day also misses species such as Spur-winged Goose, Egyptian Goose and Comb Duck, which utilise agricultural fields during the day and roost at the lakes at night (Gordon 1987, Hockey et al. 2005).

Scientists have tracked reef community composition across Belize for over 50 years, mostly in short-term, longitudinal studies [e.g., 11, 48, 5052]. Belize has an extensive, 30-plus-year-old MPA network [48, 53] and a history of frequent large-scale disturbances, including bleaching events, disease outbreaks, hurricanes, and even an earthquake (Table 1). We surveyed fore-reef benthic communities at 1518 m depth at 15 sites along the BBR during the summer months in 1997, 1999, 2005, 2009, and 2016 (Fig 1, Table 2). Due to logistical and resource constraints, only three of the 15 sites were surveyed every year: Bacalar Chico, Middle Caye, and
Tacklebox (Table 2). Study sites were selected to maximize spatial heterogeneity and spanned a range of protections or management zones, including the Bacalar Chico, Hol Chan, and Glovers Reef Marine Reserves [5, 49]. They included five sites within fully protected (FP) zones (marine reserves), where only non-extractive activities are permitted, three sites within general-use (GU) zones, where fishing is permitted with some gear restrictions (e.g., prohibi- tions on longlines, gillnets, and spear-fishing with SCUBA) and modest fishing limits (e.g., catch-size limits for queen conch and lobster), and seven sites in unprotected (NP) zones, where fishing is allowed [48] (Table 2). Enforcement of fishing regulations in FP and GU sites was variable over time and ranged from inadequate to good (Table 2). Note that national sea- sonal closures for some species (e.g., Nassau grouper) and bans (e.g., on catching parrotfishes) applied to all three management zones.
Benthic surveys
Benthic surveys were conducted in situ using SCUBA. At each site, dive teams laid out four to ten, 2530 m x 2 m belt transects down the centers of reef spurs, perpendicular to the shore- line. The transects generally began on or near the shoulders of the spurs (i.e., beginning of the slope) at 1518 m depth, shoreward of the drop-off that characterizes most of the reefs in Belize, and ran upward toward the reef crest. Transects were parallel to each other and were usually separated by >10 m. Divers worked in buddy pairs, in which one diver laid out the transect tape and the other used a digital camera in an underwater housing to obtain videos or still-frame images of the benthos. At each site, we videotaped or photographed the belt transects at a standard distance of 25 cm above the benthos, using a bar projecting from the front of the camera housing to maintain the distance from the bottom. We also surveyed for Diadema antillarum from 2009 onward, but they were generally absent or extremely rare at all sites, possibly due to their refuge-seeking behaviors during the daytime when our surveys were completed [54]. In all sampling years except 2016, we obtained underwater videos along the belt transects and extracted still frames from those videos (as outlined below). In 2016, we pho- tographed the transects using a GoPro HERO4 camera by swimming at a rate of 57 minutes along the 30-m-long transect and taking a photograph every five seconds. For photographs, we used the wide angle and 4:3 ratio setting of the GoPro camera, which corresponds to ~1630 mm focal length and results in a frame area of ~0.25 m2.",photo quadrat transects of hard coral benthos,NA,"Aggregated species percent cover to the transect level to align with sampling event structure.

Surveys monitor phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthic invertebrates, water quality, and many types of fish. Several fish surveys sample zooplankton concurrently, and information on zooplankton species composition and abundance can be coupled with fish diet studies. The IEP long-term surveys that monitor zooplankton are the Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP; also known as the IEP zooplankton study), 20-mm Survey (20mm), Fall Midwater Trawl (FMWT), Summer Townet Survey (STN), the Yolo Bypass Fisheries Monitoring Survey (not included in this integrated dataset), and the Fish Restoration Program (FRP).

Every IEP survey that collects zooplankton samples with a mesozooplankton net, which targets adult copepods and cladocerans, because these taxa are believed to comprise the majority of zooplankton in juvenile and adult planktivorous fish diets. Some surveys also sample with micro- or macro-zooplankton nets. Three size classes of zooplankton are targeted by these sampling programs with different net mesh sizes: micro zooplankton (copepods and rotifers) are targeted with a 43 µm mesh net, meso zooplankton (copepods and cladocerans) are targeted with 150 - 160 µm mesh nets, and macro zooplankton (mysids and amphipods) are targeted with 500-505 µm mesh nets.  
 The 20-mm survey was initiated in 1995 by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife to monitor postlarval-juvenile Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) distribution, abundance, and timing throughout their historical spring range in the Delta. The survey is mandated under the Endangered Species Act Biological Opinion for operation of the State and Central Valley water projects (USFWS 2019). 20-mm refers to the length of the fish targeted by the net. Zooplankton samples are collected concurrently with fish samples to monitor Delta Smelt food supply. Between 41 and 55 stations have been sampled each year since the survey began.
Zooplankton are sampled twice per month between March and July at fixed stations in open channels. Mesozooplankton are sampled using 10-minute stepped-oblique tows with a 73 cm long 160 µm mesh modified Clarke-Bumpus net. The net is attached to the top of the 20-mm net frame and a flowmeter is mounted in the mouth. Samples are preserved in 10% formalin. Lengths are not recorded, and biomass is estimated by literature values. Recorded environmental variables include times, tidal stage, depth, surface and bottom conductivity, surface temperature, Secchi depth, and turbidity.

DOP
 The Directed Outflow Project was initiated by the United States Bureau of Reclamation in 2017 to evaluate the effectiveness of fall outflow actions on Delta Smelt. Field sampling is paired with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service Enhanced Delta Smelt Monitoring. Three random sites are chosen per region (Suisun Bay, Suisun Marsh, the Lower Sacramento River, the Cache Slough Complex, and the Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel) and time period using a Generalized Random Tessellation Stratified design. Samples were collected once every two weeks in 2017 and weekly thereafter. Sampling is conducted in the fall and, starting in 2019, spring and summer seasons have also been sampled. In 2017, stations were sampled in 3 additional regions: West of the Benicia Bridge, Lower San Joaquin, and Upper Sac River. At each station, sample collection is attempted at both shoal (less than or equal to 10 feet deep) and channel (greater than 10 feet deep) habitat. Channels are sampled at the surface (0.5 m deep) and, if deeper than 20 feet, also at the bottom 1/2 to 1/3 of the water column. In 2017, oblique tows were also conducted to compare with the horizontal tows.

Locations of fixed sampling locations for surveys with fixed sampling designs are provided in stations.csv, and coordinates for every sample are provided in environment.csv. Zooplankton surveys sample 3 different size classes of zooplankton, by towing nets with different sized mesh (or in one case a pump that pumps water into a microzooplankton net).
Every IEP survey that collects zooplankton samples with a mesozooplankton net, which targets adult copepods and cladocerans, because these taxa are believed to comprise the majority of zooplankton in juvenile and adult planktivorous fish diets. Some surveys also sample with micro- or macro-zooplankton nets. Three size classes of zooplankton are targeted by these sampling programs with different net mesh sizes: micro zooplankton (copepods and rotifers) are targeted with a 43 µm mesh net, meso zooplankton (copepods and cladocerans) are targeted with 150 - 160 µm mesh nets, and macro zooplankton (mysids and amphipods) are targeted with 500-505 µm mesh nets.  
EMP
Zooplankton for EMP are sampled in 3 different size ranges: microzooplankton are sampled using a pump, mesozooplankton are sampled using a modified Clarke-Bumpus net, and macrozooplankton are sampled using a mysid net. All EMP zooplankton are collected monthly at fixed stations year-round in open channels at high slack tide and preserved in 10% formalin dyed with rose bengal. Macrozooplankton and Mesozooplankton are collected using 10-minute oblique tows with a 124 cm long net with 505 µm mesh, and a 73 cm long net with 160 µm mesh, respectively. Prior to 1974, macrozooplankton were sampled with a 930 µm mesh net. Microzooplankton are collected with a Teel marine pump while the intake hose is raised through the water column and pumped into a net with 43 µm mesh. Pump samples collected approximately 1.5 - 1.9 L from 1972  2007, and 75 L from 2008 - present, measured by a digital flowmeter connected to the hose.
Microzooplankton samples are passed through a 154 µm mesh sieve nested on top of a 43 µm mesh sieve in the lab, and only the smaller size fraction that passes through the larger sieve and is retained on the smaller sieve is counted. Lengths are recorded for macrozooplankton (but not included in this dataset), and biomass is estimated by length-weight equations for macrozooplankton and by average values for mesozooplankton and microzooplankton (biomass_mesomicro.csv).","Stations were sampled several times a year.

FMWT
 The Fall Midwater Trawl (FMWT) was initiated by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife in 1967 in order to determine the relative abundance and distribution of age-0 Striped Bass (Morone saxatilis), but the data has also been used for other upper estuary pelagic fish species, including Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), Longfin Smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys), American Shad (Alosa sapidissima), Splittail (Pogonichthys macrolepidotus), and Threadfin Shad (Dorosoma petenense). The FMWT is currently mandated by the 2019 Delta Smelt Biological Opinion for the coordinated operation of the Central Valley Project and State Water Project (USFWS 2019). The FMWT samples 122 stations each month from September to December ranging from San Pablo Bay to Stockton, Hood, and The Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel. FMWT samples both macrozooplankton and mesozooplankton at a subset of these stations since 2011, with some pilot studies in earlier years.
Zooplankton samples are collected along with the fish trawl at fixed stations in open channels using 10-minute oblique tows. Macrozooplankton are sampled using a 124 cm long net with 505 µm mesh, while mesozooplankton is sampled using a 73 cm long modified Clark-Bumpus net with 160 µm mesh. For both zooplankton sizes, samples are preserved in 10% formalin dyed with rose bengal. Lengths are recorded for macrozooplankton but not mesozooplankton, biomass is estimated for both as in EMP.

FRP
The Fish Restoration Program (FRP) is devoted to restoring 8,000 acres of tidal habitat in the Delta and Suisun Marsh to provide Delta Smelt habitat and 800 acres of low salinity habitat to benefit Longfin Smelt. These restoration projects are pursuant to requirements in the 2019 Biological Opinions for state and federal water project operations (USFWS 2019). The FRP Monitoring Team monitors fish and their food resources (including zooplankton) within these restored wetlands in order to better understand the benefits of the restored habitats to native fish species. The FRP Monitoring Team surveys zooplankton in shallow waters, generally near tidal marshes or sites that will soon be converted to tidal marsh. The FRP has worked closely with some other IEP surveys to compare zooplankton communities in shallow water to the open-water channel samples collected by the long-term surveys (Contreras et al. 2018).
Zooplankton are sampled annually to monthly between March and December beginning in 2015. Samples are taken from haphazardly selected locations within fixed sites at restored and existing wetlands and adjacent open-water areas across the Delta and Suisun Marsh. Macrozooplankton are collected with 10-minute horizontal surface tows using a 0.4 m x 0.4 m mouth net (500 µm mesh size). Mesozooplankton are collected with 5-minute surface tows using a 14.6 cm diameter net (150 µm mesh size). A flowmeter is attached to the net for both zooplankton size collections.

STN
The Summer Townet Survey (STN) was initiated by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife in 1959 in order to determine the relative abundance and distribution of upper estuary pelagic species, namely age-0 Striped Bass (Morone saxatilis). As with the FMWT, the STN is currently mandated by the 2019 Delta Smelt Biological Opinion (USFWS 2019) and began in response to the development of the Central Valley Project pumping plants. The Summer Townet Survey collects mesozooplankton samples from 32 historic stations and 8 supplemental stations ranging from San Pablo Bay to Rio Vista, Stockton, Cache Slough, and the Deep-Water Ship Channel. Zooplankton monitoring began in 2005 with samples collected every 2 weeks between June and August.
STN samples only mesozooplankton during their fish trawl with a net attached to the townet frame. Zooplankton samples are collected during 1 of the fish tows at each fixed station in open channels using 10-minute oblique tows. Mesozooplankton are sampled using a 73 cm long modified Clark-Bumpus net with 160 µm mesh and preserved in 10% formalin dyed with rose bengal. Biomass is estimated and recorded environmental variables include time, tidal stage, depth, surface and bottom conductivity, surface and bottom temperature, Secchi depth, Microcystis presence, and turbidity.

We built our database by compiling sampling events of soil invertebrates, based on an exhaustive search in published and unpublished authors' sources, as well as from the Zoological Museum of the Institute of Biology Komi SC UB RAS. The data paper is based on three datasets. The datasets about macrofauna and collembolans provides temporal data on the number of their individuals in soil cores collected in pine and spruce forests of the production area of the pulp and paper industry enterprise. The dataset about macrofauna also contains the material collected by the pitfall traps and information on the age stages (larvae and imago) of invertebrates. Nematodes were collected in pine and spruce forests of the production area of Mondi Syktyvkar JSC only in 2018-2019, so these data are not temporal. The dataset about Nematoda provides information on the number of their individuals in soil cores. Three datasets have differences in data presentation. We have combined them into one data paper, since a comprehensive study of the effect on soil invertebrates from the pulp and paper industry has not previously been carried out.
Sampling description:

Two sampling methods were used for collection of macrofauna at each site.
1. Soil sampling method. About 8-10 soil cores were randomly taken to a depth of 5-10 cm at each site. A quadrangular frame of 25 × 25 cm or 10 × 10 cm was used for sampling. Actively moving animals were placed into containers with 70% alcohol as a fixative. Further, in laboratory conditions, the extraction of invertebrates from soil cores into 70% alcohol was carried out in the funnels.

Individual plants in these quadrats were identified and mapped annually for 19?years (20022020). The original chart quadrats were established between 1912 and 1927 to determine the effects of domestic livestock grazing on herbaceous plants and pine seedlings. Today these data provide opportunities to examine the effects of climate and land-use change on plant demography, population dynamics, and community processes.
The foci of these metadata are 101 permanent 1-m2 chart quadrats from within the southwestern ponderosa pine ecosystems in northern Arizona, USA. All of these quadrats are located within 40 km of Flagstaff, AZ. They are distributed over multiple sites with varying parent materials and topography, and spanning the elevation range of the southwestern ponderosa pine forest type on the Coconino National Forest and the Fort Valley Experimental Forest (FVEF) (Bakker and Moore 2007, Laughlin et al. 2011, Strahan et al. 2015). The original location of each quadrat corner is permanently marked in the field with tagged angle iron or galvanized steel pipe, and the precise location was recorded with a GPS unit. During each growing season, all plants found on these quadrats are identified and mapped.

Luff of the University of Newcastle upon Tyne. At each site, in or adjacent to the TSS, a pitfall trapping system should be instituted to sample Carabidae (ground beetles) and the ubiquitous opilionid (Harvestmen) Mitopus morio. Adult crane- flies caught in the traps should also be retained in order to check their identification against the larvae extracted in soil cores (see separate Protocol for Tipulidae). It will be necessary to measure the length of the second femur of M. morio; this changes with altitude and latitude and may react to environmental change. All carabid beetles (not just Carabus spp.) are of interest.
Equipment
The pitfall traps are polypropylene cups, 7.5 cm diameter x 10 cm deep (see Appendix I for supplier). A wire netting cage, made from chicken wire with a mesh size approximately 15 mm x 20 mm and approximately 70 mm high, is clipped to the rim of each trap so as to reduce the number of small mammals inadvertently caught in the traps. Each trap should have a cover which can be made cheaply from 5"" diameter plant pot saucers and galvanised wire. This helps to prevent heavy rain from flooding the traps, keeps birds from interfering, and helps in their re-location.
Location
Three transects should be selected, preferably within different vegetation types and including the TSS. Transects should not be placed where cattle have access. Ten pitfall traps should be established in each transect, with 10 m spacing between the traps. If possible, transects should be approached from different directions when attending to traps so as to avoid trampling damage to the vegetation. If trampling is having an obviously deleterious long-term effect on the vegetation, a trapline can be moved each year but returned to the original position every three years. Any movement of traplines should be recorded and information sent to the Central Co-ordination Unit.
Sampling
The traps are set out on the first Wednesday in May and are then emptied and replaced fortnightly for 13 sampling periods, until the end of October.

The benthic surveys in Atna have been ongoing every year since 1986, and therefore represent one of the longest data series on benthic animals from unaffected waterways in Norway (Aagaard et al. 2004). From 2003, samples have been taken at four fixed stations: Vidjedalsbekken, Dørålseter, Vollen and Solbakken (figure 2.2.1). In 2020, the samples at station Vollen were taken upstream of the former station. Different benthic species have different life cycles, and in order to record as many species as possible, repeated sampling throughout the ice-free season is therefore necessary. At each station, kicking samples of 4 minutes duration are taken on three dates throughout the season. Every year, an attempt is made to reach the highest stations as soon as they are available. If possible, hoofing is also carried out in the vegetation to find adult individuals of mayflies, stoneflies and springflies. The samples are processed in the laboratory following a subsampling procedure where benthic animals are picked and identified until no new groups or species of benthic animals are detected. In each sample, the total number of individuals belonging to each taxa (species, genus, family or order) is determined by multiplying and summing based on the number of individuals of each taxa in the subsamples that have been counted","Minute kick sampling of benthic invertebrates from four stations during ice-free seasons, at least three samplings annually.",NA,RiverAtna_Norway_benthicinverts_AnS_CC.R,NA,AnS,NA,24-Mar,Density,NA,year_month_day_site

STEP 1: Climate manipulation
Three climate treatments have been applied to 3x3m plots:
1. Temperature has been elevated from November to April each year, beginning in November 1993. Each heated plot contains two 1000 W, 240-V AC heating cables secured to the soil surface in parallel runs spaced 50mmapart. Soil surface temperature of heated plots is maintained at 3°C above ambient by thermocouples in heated and control plots linked to a PC-based control system.
2. Rainfall has been intercepted above the vegetation throughout July and August since the summer of 1994 by means of automatically operating, semitransparent shelters that slide across the plots at the onset of rain and retreat to an off-plot position when rain ceases. Plots of intercepted summer rainfall have significantly reduced summer soil moisture levels compared with control plots, particularly within the interior 2 x 2 m subject to vegetation monitoring. In 2004, a decision was made to shift the drought treatment to alternate years (thus suspending simulated droughts in 2004 and 2006).
3. Since 1994, additional water has been added on a monthly basis to the plots during the months of June to September (inclusive), to maintain an input at least 20% above the long-term (19721982) Buxton average for each month.
In addition to treatments 1, 2, and 3, two combinations, (1&2) and (1&3),have been maintained. All five treatments, together with untreated controls, are included in a fully randomized block, replicated 5 times.
STEP 2: Vegetation composition data collection
In October each year the vegetation has been cut to a height of 4050 mm, and the cuttings have been removed to simulate annual sheep grazing. Over the course of the experiment estimates of annual species abundance in each plot have been made by point-quadrat analysis. Each year we record the number of contacts with living shoots of each vascular plant species when 25 steel pins of diameter 2.5 mm are lowered vertically into the vegetation occupying the central (2.52.5 m) area of each plot. In 2003, surveys were changed from June/July to early October. Species data were not collected in 2005, 2007, and 2008.SUMMARY: The Buxton Climate Change Impacts study was established in 1992 on a steep daleside of calcareous grassland outside Buxton, Derbyshire, UK. The vegetation has been surveyed annually since 1994 with nondestructive point quadrat touches (with gaps in 2005, 2007, and 2008) in early summer that correlate with total plot biomass. In five replicate blocks of 3 x 3 m plots, the vegetation has been subjected to climate treatments of winter heating (3C above ambient, Nov-April), summer drought (no rain, July-Aug), summer augmented rainfaill (20% above the long-term average, June-Sept), and two interaction treatments (heating-drought, heating-watered) in addition to replicated controls. The grassland is maintained in a short turf to simulate sheep and cattle grazing each autumn (Oct).

FM Kusaki is located at the upper Watarase river basin, in Midori City, Gunma Prefecture, central Japan (36°32?N, 139°25?E; 640?m to 1,140?m?a.s.l., Figure 1). This site belongs to a cool temperate region (warmth index, 69.6°C; coldness index 21.7°C). The mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation from 1997 to 2013 were 9.0°C and 1807?mm, respectively (Koyanagi et al., 2003; Urakawa et al., 2015). Precipitation increases in mid-summer and decreases in winter, and snow precipitation is at most approximately 300?mm (Urakawa et al., 2015). The bed rock in this area is mainly composed of sandstone and clayslate. Sika deer (Cervus nippon) population has been increasing since 2000 in Gunma Prefecture, and was estimated to be more than 1,500 in Midori City (ca. 208?km2) in 2012 (Gunma Prefecture, 2015). In FM Kusaki, herbivory by Sika deer is markedly increasing yearly. A 1-ha permanent plot (100?m?×?100?m) for elucidating long-term forest dynamics was established at a deciduous broad-leaved forest in a wide valley bottom of FM Kusaki in 2005 shown in Figure 1. This plot was subdivided into horizontal 10 m?×?10 m grid cells (Watanabe, Kuwabara, Hoshino, Kuwabara, & Kaneko, 2007), according to methods of the Monitoring Sites 1000 Project in Japan (Ministry of the Environment, 2011). To include vegetation from the valley bottom to the ridge condition, we expanded the plot by increasing the number of grid cells (10 m?×?10 m), resulting in a total of ca. 3-ha plot in the forest, although the dataset only currently includes data from the 1 ha plot. There are active channels (less than 1 m width) and microtopographies such as alluvial fans, talus slopes, foot slopes, head hollows and channel walls, leading to various ground disturbances in this plot. In addition, deer fences were built with 2-m wooden poles and iron wires or nylon nets at 6 grid cells in 2009 for elucidating effects of deer grazing on vegetation as shown in Figure 1.
The dominant tree species were F. platypoda on the valley bottom, and Quercus crispula and Castanea crenata on the side slope in the 1 ha permanent plot (Fukamachi, Hoshino, Yoshikawa, & Watanabe, 2011). On the western exterior of the plot, there was a conifer plantation. This oak and chestnut secondary forest may have been used for cutting fuelwood because there was a trace of charcoal grill kiln at the valley bottom. The forest stand including the plot, belonged to the national forest and the last record of forest operations was in 1893. Our dataset was based on the standardized methods of the Monitoring Sites 1000 Project in Japan (Ministry of the Environment, 2011). All living trees including lianas with girth at breast height (GBH)???15?cm in the 1-ha plot were attached with aluminum numbering tags (Racetrack Aluminum Tags, Forestry Supplies Inc.), and were identified at species level. The position of each tree base was measured from one corner of the grid cell as the X and Y coordinates in the grid cells. A tree census was conducted at this plot in August and September of each year since 2005. The census included GBH, tree height, death, tree vigor and recruitment (individuals growing GBH???15?cm in the survey year). About tree vigor,” we have checked visually and recorded in remarks in the table such as condition of tree tip, presence of rot and damages by nearby tree and deer.SUMMARY: Data collected in censuses of trees, litter fall and vegetation in a mountain riparian forest, upstream of the Watarase river, Gunma Prefecture in central Japan. A 1 - ha permanent plot (100m × 100m) subdivided into horizontal 10m × 10m grid cells was established in the forest in 2005. Tree census with woody species  larger or equal to 15 cm girth at breast height was conducted every year from 2005. Twenty - five litter traps were set in the permanent plot. The samples of litter fall were collected monthly, except in winter, between 2005 and 2008. And we sorted into leaves, branches, reproductive organs and other plant material, at species level as much as possible. The percentage cover of vascular plants was recorded at each vertical stratification (tree layer, subtree layer, shrub layer and herb layer) in 2008 and 2014 at the plot.

Translated from Finnish. Standardized observation:
For Halias, the person appointed as an observer must complete a four-hour standard observation period, the so-called morning routine from the observation bunker in the middle of Uddskatan (the map is available at the station). The morning train starts around sunrise, the exact time is on the list on the station door. During the morning routine, all migrating birds are marked in half-hour intervals (e.g. 8:00, 8:30...). Some of the change is clear and straightforward, but a large part of the small birds, for example, only turn around at the tip of the cape and fly back in the direction of the mainland. A good rule of thumb is that birds that pass the bunker are marked as moving. Common sense should also be used here and, for example, clearly the same individuals should not be marked again. The station has purpose-made change tracking forms and a handy folder,
In addition to migrants, all local birds observed during the day and their numbers are recorded. However, the bird species that in the systematic order of species are after the riskier bird (pigeons, woodpeckers, spinners, owls, barn swallows and sparrows) are only counted as so-called from the standard area, i.e. from the tip area of ??Uddskatan. The border of the Lintuasema area extends to the base of the promontory, to the fence at the beginning of the nature trail. Demarcation of the area and more information can be found in the observation instructions folder.
It is also a good idea to go to Gåsörsudden, which is located 1.5 km northeast of the station, to count birds along the shore of the station. When moving off-road, outside the marked paths, the station's observers use the attention vests found in the station's vestibule. It is strictly forbidden to move around the car parks and elsewhere in the free port area.
The day's migration and local observations are compiled at the end of the evening on both an electronic and a paper station form, the latter are on the bookshelf in the hut. The move is entered on the electronic station form, which calculates the move together and the morning constant separately (read more about the observation instructions). The change observation forms are attached to the paper status form and folded. In addition, the best observations are recorded daily in the Tiira database, instructions for this are available at the station.
Ringing: The tire changers must carry out a standard tire change every day during the period 15.3.  30.11., when it is possible due to the weather. More detailed instructions are in the station's observation instructions folder. If you are interested in obtaining a station tire permit, read more here .
In spring, observation is more important than ringing, but in autumn migration observation and ringing are equally important and complement each other when collecting observational material. About 10,000 birds are ringed at Halias every year, mainly titmice. The main ringing season is from mid-July to mid-November.. SUMMARY: Daily bird observations carried out between 1970 and 2019 (The original dataset includes mammal sightings, but as this where only introduced in 2020, the dataset has been clipped at 2019). Counts consisted of one to seven observers trapping birds for ringing, and counting birds in migratory flight and those resting at the Hanko observatory. The combination of all observation activities including the number of ringed birds resulted in a daily bird count.","Daily bird observations from 1970 to 2019 involved one to seven observers at the Hanko observatory, trapping birds for ringing and counting migratory and resting birds.",NA,Hanko_LTER_Aves_JC.R.

Location of Sampling Stations: Grasshopper density is determined on upland topographic locations. C3A, C3B, C3C, C1A, C3SA, C3SB, C3SC, C1B. 4 sits per watershed, 4 transects per site.
Frequency of Sampling: Grasshopper abundances are sampled once in late summer (August-September), with each site sample twice in a season a week apart.
Variable Measured: Number of individuals (categorized by instar) for individual grasshopper species.
Methods: Three watershed units (C3A, C3B, C3C) constitute 'patches' that are alternately burned in a 3-year rotation within a single, fenced pasture (i.e., patch-burn grazing). Two additional watersheds are serving as controls: a grazed, annually/uniformly-burned watershed (C1A) and an ungrazed, annually/uniformly-burned watershed (1D).
Grasshopper sampling is done by standardized sweeping with canvas beating nets 38 cm in diameter. A sample of 250 sweeps (ten sets of 25 sweeps each) is taken at each site (4 independent sites per watershed) on each occasion. A sweep is taken at each step by traversing an arc of 1805 with the net through the top layer of vegetation. After 25 such sweeps, the contents of the net are emptied into individual plastic bags. Air is squeezed out and samples are kept on ice until they can be later frozen that same day. Samples are sorted and identified to species and instar at a later date. Samples are taken between 1000 and 1500 hours on clear, calm warm days: cloud cover is less than 50%, wind speed less than 24km per hr (15 mph), and ambient air temperature should be 25-40oC.
Sampling is replicated at each site a week apart. Sweep sampling methods follow those used for grasshopper sampling in the bison grazed watersheds. Sweeping effectiveness varies with site and season on Konza Prairie (e.g. sweeping is less effective on unburned prairie than on burned prairie). However, sweeping provides good estimates of relative abundances of individual species present at any one place and time on both burned and unburned prairie.

SUMMARY: Effects of patch-burn grazing management on plant and animal diversity and the nature and variety of wildlife habitat are being assessed in two replicate management units, each consisting of three pastures (watersheds) designated C03A/C03B/C03C and C3SA/C3SB/C3SC. In each patch-burn grazing unit, one watershed is burned and two that are left unburned in a given year. The burning treatments are rotated annually so that each pasture is burned every third year. Each patch-burn grazing unit is paired with an annually-burned pasture for comparison with traditional grazing systems (C01A and C1SB). All grazing units are stocked with cow/calf pairs from approximately 1 May until 1 Oct at a stocking density equal to 3.2 ha per cow/calf. To examine the impact of patch burning and grazing in all 8 units, we monitor changes in plant species composition, residual biomass, grassland bird populations, insect populations, small mammal populations, soil nutrients, and stream water quality1(1C3SA/C3SB/C3SC unit only). The KSU Department of Animal Science monitors cattle performance, including weight gain and body condition to assess the economic feasibility of using patch-burn management on a widespread basis.","Relative abundance of grasshoppers in the Patch-Burn Grazing experiment estimated by sweep netting (PBG072, formerly CGR022x).",NA,"Joern_2020_JC.R.

We established a factorial experiment that manipulates N (0 or 3 g m-2 yr-1), fire (none or every 2nd year), and deer (fenced or open to deer), with a total of 32 plots, each 20 x 20 m. We hypothesized that the response of this ecosystem to the combined effects of fire, N, and herbivory would depend on the ability of pine and other species to invade and the magnitude of their response to the different disturbance factors: warm-season grasses increase with and encourage fire, resist herbivores, and inhibit woody plant invasion (Davis et al. 1998, Inouye et al. 1994); cool-season plants are favored by N deposition (Tilman 1987) but are fire-intolerant and palatable to herbivores; legumes tolerate fire but decrease with herbivory and N deposition; and finally, woody plants are fire-intolerant and may be more susceptible to herbivory. We are measuring treatment effects on composition and diversity of plants and consumers (insects, small mammals, lizards) as well as plant and soil C and N. Data set here contains only control plot (i.e. no fertilizer, no deer exclusion, and no fire treatment). Plot establishment:
Thirty-two 20 x 20 m plots were established in field B in fall 2000 (see plot map). To reduce edge effects, each plot has a 5 m wide buffer zone along each interior side of the fence/edge. This leaves a central 10 x 10 m area (marked with orange-tipped rebar) in which most sampling takes place. The experiment design is factorial, with treatments consisting of deer exclosure fences, nitrogen addition, and prescribed burning. Treatments assigned to each plot are found in the treatment table below. Within each plot there is also a 1 sq. m plowed area (located outside of the central 10 x 10 m area). Deer exclosure fences were constructed of 6 ft tall hardware cloth with an opening size of 2 x 4 in. Aluminum flashing was stapled to the bases of fence posts to protect them from burning. All trees were removed from the 4 m wide area between plots, as well as the out perimeter of the experiment. This buffer provides space for fire vehicles during prescribed burns. Trees within plots that were large enough to pose a fire hazard were removed, as were large trees near fences. This reduced potential damage to the fences, while not disturbing the inner plot where most measurements are made.
Species inventory:
A comprehensive species list was compiled for each plot. Species were listed as common (c), occasional (o), or rare (r). Rare species occurred 1-3 times in the plot, common species were abundant and evenly distributed throughout the plot and occasional species consisted of everything in between. This information was first collected in July 2001, by Heidi Hillhouse, John Haarstad, Jean Knops, Jeffrey Arnold, Steven Metzger, and Sarah Went. A second species inventory was done September 13-14 in 2005, by Joel Zak, Steph Pimm, Daniel (Todd) Dalton, Kally Worm and David DeVetter. The amount of time spent searching in each plot was limited to 15 minutes. A * following the abundance code indicated that the species was present in the 1 x 1 m tilled area but was either absent or present in a lower abundance category in the rest of the plot.
Arthropod sweepnet sampling
All 32 plots were sampled for arthropods in 2003-2006 using a 38 cm diameter muslin sweep net to take 50 sweeps per plot. A ?sweep? consisted of a quick, approximately 2-meter-long horizontal swing of the net. Sampling dates were: 15/Aug/03, 19/Aug/04, 16/Jun/05, 12/July/05, 12/Aug/05, 16/Jun/06, 15/Aug/06. Samples were frozen, then sorted under magnification. Arthropods were generally identified to species or genus, but occasionally a morphological descriptive was used when identification was uncertain. Sample collection and sorting was done by John Haarstad.
Arthropod sweepnet sampling: Data Preparation
Data preparation was begun by John Haarstad and Stephanie Pimm Lyon. It was completed by Colleen Satyshur, primarily using the access database that Stephanie prepared for Big Bio and which she used in preparing some of this data, but also using a CODE file J.Haarstad included with his latest data files. *Note about comparing experiments: morphological notes may not indicate the same species/group in different experiments.","Sweepnet sampling, with 50 sweeps per plot.",NA,"Retained only abundance records from control plots - no fertilizer added, no deer exclusion, and no periodic fire treatment.

Small mammal trapping:
In the summers of 2003-2005, small mammals were live-trapped in each of the 32 plots. 4 traps were set in each plot, one per side of the inner 10 x 10 m sampling area. The traps were set approximately halfway between each of the corner posts and slightly to the outside of the inner sampling area (see sampling diagram). Traps were labeled according to the side of the plot they were located on (N, S, E, W). Each week, traps were set out on Sunday after 4 PM, and picked up after the Friday evening survey. Traps were checked twice a day, starting at 6 AM and 6 PM (in 2004-5 checked only once a day). Baits were checked every morning, and replaced as necessary. A tight wad of vegetation approx 2? x 3.5? was used when trapping voles. Any trap not physically capable of capturing animals (not sensitive enough, set off by deer, etc.) was recorded as NTAV (= no trap available) at the time that traps were checked. Captured individuals were recorded as a new capture (N) or a recapture (R). [?P? used for individuals marked in a previous trapping period.] New captures were weighed and tagged. When an individual was recaptured, the numbers on its ear tags were recorded and missing tags were replaced as necessary. Sex (M, F), age (J = Juvenile; usually all gray & small; A = Adult; usually all brown & large; S = Sub-adult; combination of both conditions; U = Unsure), species, and status at release (U = Released unharmed; C = Dead and collected; D = Dead but not collected; H = Hypothermic, treated &released; I = Injured in trap, released; E = Escaped unharmed) were also recorded, along with any unusual or important observations about the captured individual (e.g. deformities, extent of injuries, escapees, notes on burrow use, etc.). A more detailed protocol can be found in ?smmammlprotocol2003.doc?. Note on data: As of August 2007, we do not have raw mammal data for the summer of 2003.

For the Main Cropping System Experiment (MCSE), abundances are monitored weekly throughout the growing season (early May to late August) at each of the five permanent sampling stations per replicate in all treatments except in the Mown Grassland Never-tilled treatment (T8). Permanent sampling sites allow monitoring of temporal variation (weeks, years) while accounting for spatial variation. For the MCSE treatment plots, a total of 255 sampling stations are monitored [(since 1989, 7 treatments at the LTER Main Site x 6 replicates x 5 stations) + (since 1993, 3 successional and forest site x 3 replicates x 5 stations)]. Since 2019, monitoring also occurs at 3 sampling stations per prairie strip in T3 and T4.Procedure
Weekly counts:
Scan the sticky trap to get an overall impression of the abundance of species present. Use the pictorial key to assist in identification.
Count the total number of adults of each species (on both sides of the sticky trap) for all species listed on the insect abundance datasheet , record number on the datasheet, and remove each individual from the sticky trap. Species that are not listed on the datasheet (e.g., flies etc.) can be left adhering to the sticky trap.
Collect individuals of unknown or rare species (in the families Coccinellidae, Chrysopidae, Lampyridae, and Cantharidae) that are not listed on the datasheet into a sample vial containing 70% ethanol for preservation and taxonomic identification. Label the vial with date and sampling location.
Trap maintenance:
Replace all sticky traps every two weeks. Secure trap onto the supporting pole using the twist ties provided by the supplier. Replace trap earlier if trap surface has less than 80% sticky surface remaining due to dust or insect accumulation. Also replace traps if they are found on the ground or damaged in any way. Note trap changes on the datasheet.
Remove supporting poles from plots as needed for agronomic procedures. Return poles to respective sampling locations as soon as possible; if poles cannot be replaced immediately, after pesticide treatment for example, be sure to record the number of days that traps were absent on the datasheet.
Data management:
Field Datasheets are collected from field technicians monthly and scanned into PDFs.
Vials with specimens needing expert identification are collected and identified back on campus. The datasheet is updated as new taxa are identified.
Field datasheets are transcribed onto an Excel workbook template and quality checked for errors. For each species on the datasheet, the number (raw count) of adults on the sticky trap is recorded (0, 1, 2, etc.).
The targeted species of interest may be revised if abundances, regularity, and/or research interests warrant. For examples, the column where Carabids” were previously recorded (but rarely observed ion sticky traps) was replaced with Cantharids in 2018.
The final step is to transfer the data from the Excel workbook into the Database using R Statistical Software.Sampling:

The time period of data collection varied among the 11 kelp forest sites. Sampling at Bulito, Carpinteria, and Naples began in summer 2000, sampling at the other six mainland sites (Arroyo Burro, Arroyo Hondo, Arroyo Quemado, Goleta Bay, Isla Vista, Mohawk) began in summer 2001 (transects 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 at Isla Vista were added in fall 2011). Data collection at the two Santa Cruz Island sites began in summer 2004. Annual measurements of the abundance of all understory macroalgae including small M. pyrifera (< 1 m in height) were converted to de-calcified dry mass using taxon-specific relationships with percent cover or size-specific density developed for 23 taxa that accounted for more than 95% of the standing biomass of understory macroalgae averaged across locations sampled seasonally from 2008 to 2018 (algae biomass relationship data table in
https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=knb-lter-sbc&identifier=127. The conversion of abundance to de-calcified dry mass for less common taxa was done by proxy using the relationship generated for a morphologically similar species. Biomass was converted from de-calcified dry mass to units of wet mass and ash free dry mass using ratios developed from tissue samples collected for common taxa. Wet mass and ash free dry mass of less common taxa were calculated using conversions for proxy taxa, when necessary.
Decalcified dry to wet mass, decalcified dry to ash free dry mass, decalcified dry to carbon mass, and decalcified dry to nitrogen mass conversions are provided in data package https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=knb-lter-sbc&identifier=127. Proxy species for these measures are presented in. Biomass for the seagrass, Zostera marina, was converted from de-calcified dry mass to wet mass using the relationship of Wickham et al. 2018 and was converted from de-calcified dry mass to carbon, nitrogen, and ash-free dry mass using the relationship of Van Lent et al. 1991. Size data for understory species whose abundance is measured as density (i.e., the kelps Pterygophora californica and Laminaria farlowii, and the fucoid, Stephanocystis osmundaceae) were not collected prior to 2008. To estimate the biomass of these species prior to 2008 we derived relationships between decalcified dry mass and density for adult and juveniles of each species using data from all sites and transects from 2008-2018. We applied the slope of these relationships to measured adult and juvenile densities to estimate the dry mass of these species
from 2000-2007. Divers also counted the density of M. pyrifera fronds > 1 m in height in the 40 m x 2 m transects. The density of M. pyrifera fronds > 1 m in height was converted to the biomass of giant kelp by applying the relationship between frond density (no. m-2) in August and dry mass density (dry kg
m-2) developed by Rassweiler et al. (2018). Annual measurements of the abundance of macroinvertebrate species were converted to shell free (i.e., decalcified) dry mass using taxon-specific relationships with size-specific density or percent cover developed for the 78 most common taxon (invertebrate biomass relationship data table in https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=knb-lter-sbc&identifier=127. Size data for invertebrates were not collected prior to 2008. Thus for 2000 to 2007 we estimated species-specific biomass of invertebrates for each transect using the long-term (2008 to present) mean size of juveniles and adults for that transect multiplied by their measured density. The conversion of abundance to mass for less common invertebrate taxa was done by proxy using the relationship generated for a morphologically similar species. Annual measurements of the abundance and size of reef fish (i.e., those observed within 2m of the
benthos) was converted to wet mass (g) using species-specific relationships obtained from the
literature (fish biomass relationship data table in https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=knb-lter-sbc&identifier=127. For somespecies, relationships were derived for standard length to mass. In these cases, we used information provided from the author to convert measurements of total length to standard length
prior to estimating wet mass. The wet mass of bony fishes was converted to de-boned dry mass (g) and ash free dry mass (g) using the average of conversion ratios for all reef fish provided in Taylor (1997). Wet mass of cartilaginous fishes was converted to dry biomass (g) using the conversion factor of Thorson 1976. No information was found to convert wet mass to ash free dry mass for cartilaginous fishes. Published relationships were not available for every fish species encountered on SBC LTER reefs. Therefore, we estimated the biomass of these species by proxy using the relationship published for a morphologically similar species (Table 3). Note, the accuracy of sampling fish may vary with water clarity and data collected during sampling events when horizontal visibility was < 2 m should be used with caution.  SUMMARY: These data are part of a collection of ongoing data sets that describe the temporal and spatial dynamics of kelp forest communities in the Santa Barbara Channel. Data on the abundance (density or percent cover) and size of ~250 species of reef associated macroalgae, invertebrates and fishes, substrate type and bottom topography are collected annually by divers in the summer within fixed plots (i.e. 40 m x 2 m transects) at 11 sites (n = 2 to 8 transects per site) that have historically supported giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera). Species-specific relationships between size (or percent cover) and mass developed for the region are used to covert abundance data to common metrics of mass (e.g., wet, dry, de-calcified dry) to facilitate analyses of community dynamics involving all species. Data collection began in 2000 and is ongoing.",Data collected within fixed plots (i.e. 40 m x 2 m transects) at 11 sites (n = 2 to 8 transects per site) that have historically supported giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera).,NA,Dry weight selected as measure of biomass (Dry weight versus weight) as it better accounts for differences in water retention across taxa.

All sites are located nearStolzenau and Leese (Lower Saxony) in the lowlandsof northern Germany. Marchand selected his sitesaccording to a moisture gradient with the result thatthere are three types of habitat (table 1): (i) drygrassland (sites I and II), (ii) mesic grassland (sitesIIIIV) and (iii) moist grassland (sites XXII). Themode and extent of agricultural land use were alsorecorded. Four of the plots were not mown or grazedin 2009, while in 1951 each plot was mown at leastonce a year (table 1). Marchand gave brief descrip-tions of the plant communities present in 1951,which were helpful in rediscovering the plots. Someof these plots have changed severely during the past60 years. Three sites (VII, VIII and IX) had been con-verted to arable fields since 1951 and could not beincluded in the study. In all other cases, sufficientlysimilar habitats were still present to permit sampling.The weather in both sampling periods was largelycomparable: the mean annual precipitation of Ger-many was 751 mm in 1951 and 813 mm in 2009(data received from Deutscher Wetterdienst). Meanspring and summer precipitation slightly differed by7 and 8 mm between both periods. In contrast,mean autumn precipitation was 48 mm higher in2009 when compared with 1951. Mean annual tem-perature rose from 8.7°C in 1951 to 9.2°C in 2009. We sampled eight times at each site beginning inMay and ending in September 2009, trying to matchsampling dates of Marchand as closely as possible(Appendix S1). Marchand sampled with a sweep net(Ø 30 cm; 100 beats per sampling); we used the samemethod and assume that comparisons between yearsare justified. Research has shown that transect sur-veys by different teams at the same sites but on differ-ent routes may produce similar rankings in insectspecies abundance (Schlicht et al. 2009). For A and H,sampling by sweep net is an adequate technique toobtain reliable information about insect communitycomposition and abundance in grassland and scrubhabitats (To ?rma ?la ?1982; Buffington and Redak 1998;Standen 2000). For O, the use of sweep nets is lesseffective and it is recommended to supplement sam-pling with other methods such as acoustical surveys.No other methods besides sweep nets were employedin 1951, and therefore, only sweep nets were used in2009; as a result, information on species identity in Ocommunities should be considered with caution.However, recent work indicates that using sweep netsto sample O can still be valid in comparisons of abun-dance (Gardiner et al. 2005).Only some vegetation samples from the 1950swere available. In 2009, in each site we sampled one10·10 m plot and recorded all vascular plants andan estimate of their cover along with exact localityinformation. We compared aerial photographs of the1950s with photographs from 2008 to assess thedevelopment of the vegetation in the plots and theirimmediate surroundings, i.e. changes in size of ara-ble fields, wood cover and grassland cover. We com-piled relevant life history traits for each speciesbased on the studies by Nickel (2003) and Wach-mann et al. (2004). For A, we examined four traits:degree of host plant specialism (monophagous: onehost plant species; second degree monophagous: one host plant genus; oligophagous: one host plant fam-ily; second degree oligophagous: two host plant fam-ily or up to four host plant species each belonging toup to four different families; polyphagous: varioushost plants from many different families), voltinism(usually one or two generations per year), over-win-tering stage (egg, nymph or adult) and dispersal abil-ity (flightless short-winged brachypterous or mobilelong-winged  macropterous  morphs).  For  H,  weincluded habitat requirements (preference for dry,mostly dry, dry or wet, mostly wet or wet condi-tions), over-wintering stage (egg or adult; over-win-tering juveniles were not present), feeding type(phytophagous,  phytozoophagous  or  zoophagous)and voltinism.

Initial surveys were conducted in March 2015. The location of the site was marked by GPS and we revisited 11 of the same islands (5 rat-free and 6 rat-infested) 2-4 years after a major climate extreme. The reefs of the Chagos Archipelago were severely bleached as a result of warm-water anomalies during 20152016, which caused mass coral bleaching throughout the Indian and Pacific oceans. Ten of the islands in the Chagos Archipelago were revisited in May 2018, and one island was revisited in March 2019, due to weather and logistical constraints.
We censused all diurnal, non-cryptic fishes along four replicate 30 m transects, spaced 10?m apart, on the lagoonal side of each island (13?m depth, 110-325 m from shore). Large and mobile fishes were counted in a 5-m-wide belt during a first pass along the transect, and damselfishes (Pomacentridae) were counted in a 2-m-wide belt during a second pass along the same transect. For all individuals greater than 7?cm total length (TL), the species and size (TL, visually estimated to the nearest cm) were recorded. The same observer (NAJG) conducted all fish surveys. Fish counts were converted to biomass using published species-specific lengthweight relationships (from FishBase). Along the same transects, we quantified benthic cover using line and point-intercept methods and structural complexity using a standard visual scale ranging from 0 (no relief) to 5 (exceptionally complex relief).

The route is selected so as to be reasonably representative of the ECN site and will often follow existing paths or boundaries and include areas under different management regimes. If necessary, the route should be marked out to ensure that the same route is followed on each occasion. The length of the transect will depend on local conditions but should be capable of being walked at a comfortable, even pace in 30-90 minutes and will therefore usually be 1-2 km. The transect should be divided into a maximum of 15 sections, which may be of different vegetation, structure, or management and which are used as sampling strata. The length of each section is recorded on a map, together with information on habitat types and abundant plants, especially butterfly food plants. Management operations in the vicinity of the transect are also recorded. Changes in these characteristics are noted, so as to assist in interpretation of results. 
Recording of the transect takes place weekly between 1 April and 29 September, between 10.45 and 15.45 BST. The temperature should be 13-17°C if sunshine is at least 60%, but if the temperature is above 17°C recording can be carried out in any conditions, providing that it is not raining. At northern, upland sites the appropriate upper temperature is 15°C. The use of more than one recorder would make recording easier at the peak of the season when high numbers of different species occur, or to provide cover for an absent recorder. Transects should be walked by someone with a good knowledge of the British butterfly fauna.
The transect is walked at an even pace and the number of butterflies which are seen flying within or passing through an imaginary box, 5 m wide, 5 m high, and 5 m in front of the observer, are recorded by species for each section of the transect, using the forms provided.

Data managers note: this dataset contains only a subset of the original data, containing only pitfall trap data from control plots.
The ongoing, long-term experiment is being conducted simultaneously at two sites, Harvard Forest and Duke Forest. There are a total of 15 experimental plots in the forest understorey at each site. Twelve of the plots have chambers: nine are heated and three are unheated chamber controls. Each site also has three chamberless control plots that lack chambers but are equal in surface area to the chambers.
The octagonal chambers are 21.7 m3 in volume: 5 m in diameter with eight walls each 1.90 m wide and 1.2 m long. Each chamber has a ± 20-cm-diameter oak tree (Quercus rubra at Harvard Forest and Quercus alba at Duke Forest).
We use monthly pitfall trapping and annual Winkler sampling to assess the composition, phenology and abundance of arthropod communities within the experiment; each plot has four pitfall traps (5 cm diameter) that are located c. 1 m inside of the chamber walls or edges of the chamberless control plots. Each month, pitfall traps are filled with 6080 mL of 95% EtOH and left uncovered for 48 h during precipitation-free conditions. Once during the summer (JulyAugust), we also collect organic matter and loose surface soil in two 0.25-m × 0.25-m quadrats on opposite sides of the plots. Litter is placed into Winkler extractors (Fisher, 1998); all arthropods captured are sorted, identified, counted and stored in 95% EtOH. Arthropod specimens are catalogued and stored at the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ), Harvard Forest, or North Carolina State University.",In situ temperature manipulation using heated chambers around oak trees.

HF-HeRE is sited in Petersham, Massachusetts, within the 121-ha Simes tract at the Harvard Forest (42.4742.48° N, 72.2272.21° W; 215300 m a.s.l). A full description of HF-HeRE is in Ellison et al. (2010); only pertinent details are mentioned here. The experiment, established in 2003, consists of eight ?90 × 90 m (0.81-ha) plots, divided into two blocks. The four plots in the valley” block are situated in the central valley of the tract, whereas those on the ridge” block are ?500 m northeast of the valley plots. The valley block is characterized by poorly drained, swampy soils. Besides T. canadensis, A. rubrum, P. strobus, and mixed hardwoods are common in the valley block. Soils in the ridge block are better drained, and this area is dominated by Q. rubra, Q. alba L., and P. strobus, in addition to T. canadensis.
Within each block, three hemlock-dominated (>65% of the canopy and basal area) plots and one hardwood plot were sited at the beginning of the experiment. Of the three hemlock-dominated plots, one was left untreated as a hemlock control” while the other two were manipulated. In the girdled” plots, the bark and cambium of every individual hemlock stem were cut through in May 2005 to simulate rapid decline and tree death associated with adelgid infestation (Yorks et al. 2003). In the logged” plots all hemlocks >20 cm DBH, 50% of merchantable oak and pine, and some poor-quality red maple and birch (for firewood) were felled and removed between February and April 2005 to mimic standard silvicultural practices used to salvage the value of the timber before the adelgid arrives (Foster and Orwig 2006). Because of the large size of the plots and the aspect of the blocks, plots were not randomly arrayed. Rather, to avoid shading manipulated plots in each block by the associated hemlock control plot, logged plots were always sited south of hemlock control plots, and girdled plots were in between the logged and hemlock control plots. Plots were separated from one another by 510 m. The fourth plot in each block was a hardwood control” plot dominated by young hardwoods, and which represented the expected near-term (2050 year) structure of forests from which hemlock has been lost (i.e., a space-for-time substitution) (Albani et al. 2010). In each block, the hardwood control was located >100 m from the three hemlock plots. Together, these four plot types are intended to serve as a short-term chronosequence of forests invaded by the adelgid; hemlock control plots represent hemlock stands pre-invasion, girdled and logged plots represent the immediate effects of infestation and salvage logging respectively, and hardwood control plots represent the eventual future of invaded stands.
Within each canopy treatment plot, six 3 × 3 m ant manipulation subplots were installed in April 2006. Three subplot types were installed: control,” disturbance control,” and ant exclosure.” Each subplot type was replicated twice within each canopy treatment plot and was randomly sited within the 7200 m2 area of the canopy manipulation plot outside of the central 30 × 30 m core” area (which is otherwise intensively sampled for many other variables: Ellison et al. 2010) and at least 15 m from the edge of the canopy manipulation plot. This split-plot design (small replicate ant manipulation subplots within each large canopy manipulation plot) was used to separate direct effects of changes in ant assemblage structure on soil ecosystem variables from those caused by canopy manipulations and adelgid infestation, which themselves may affect ant species composition (Ellison et al. 2005a, Sackett et al. 2011).
In each of the ant manipulation and associated control subplots, two 7-cm diameter × 10-cm deep, 230-ml plastic cups (pitfall traps”) were buried flush with the soil surface. From 2006 through 2014, three times each summer, traps were opened, partially filled (20 ml) with a mixture of water and a few drops of dishwashing detergent, and then left uncovered for 48 hours, after which time all ants in the pitfalls were removed, counted, and identified to species following Ellison et al. (2012). Voucher specimens are deposited in Harvard University's Museum of Comparative Zoology. In addition to supplying necessary data on ant assemblages that could be associated with changes in soil ecosystem variables, data from the control pitfalls were used to test for differences in ant assemblage composition among the canopy treatment plots, and data from the exclosures were used to verify that the exclosures effectively reduced ant activity.",Monthly pitfall trap monitoring of ants in experimental plots,NA,Curator transformed provided coordinates from NAD83 Massachusetts to WGS84 decimal degrees.

Among these streams, the planted Otoineppu bypass route of national road intersects three streams (Kotohira stream, Tonbetsubou stream, and Katounosawa stream) (Figure 1). They were considered as bypass road construction streams because the road construction may affect fish community and stream environmental characteristics. In contrast, the two other streams (Toyomanai stream and Tentonosawa stream) were not intersected by the planted bypass route. They were considered as control streams. Toyomanai stream is about 7.4 km in length and is control stream. This stream has two sampling sites (A1 and A2) (Table 2). Between them, there is an erosion control dam without fishway (Figure 1). Kotohira stream is about 11.5 km in length and is bypass road construction streams. This stream has five sampling sites (B1B5). In the autumn of 2009, a fishway was established in the erosion control dam between B3 and B4. In the summer of 2010, a fishway was established in the dam between B4 and B5. In the winter of 2013, the dam upstream of B5 was modified with slit (Umatani & Okuda, 2017). In addition, hatchery-reared chum salmon were released in the spring from 2005 to 2009. Tonbetsubou stream is about 5.9 km in length and is bypass road construction streams. This stream has one sampling site (C1). Katounosawa stream is about 2.3 km in length and is bypass road construction streams. This stream has one sampling site (D1). Tentonosawa stream is a tributary of Otoineppu stream about 14.3 km in length and is control stream. This stream has one sampling site (E1). At each sampling site, fish were sampled in a length of approximately 50?m. The fish sampling was conducted three times a year from 1999 to 2018 (mainly June, August and October). However, the sampling was not conducted for some sites and some periods (Table 3). The three?pass removal method using an electrofishing unit (Smith?Root, model 12B or LR24) was performed for sampling fishes. The three?pass removal method is to repeat the sampling of fish in a 50?m channel three times at each site to estimate the fish population at each site (DeLury, 1951). However, the single?pass removal method was used for A1 in autumn of 2005 and B4 in autumn of 2007. The sampled fish were anesthetized with 2?phenoxyethanol and species or taxon was identified. Body size and body weight were measured to the nearest 1?mm (Body size of the cyprinid and salmonid fish was measured by fork length, the other species was measured by total length) and the nearest 0.1 g, respectively. After awakening, the sampled fish were released. Although immature individuals of Tribolodon were sampled in these streams, they (e.g., T. hakonensis, T. sachalinenisis and T. brandtii) were difficult to identify the species in the field. Thus, they were treated as Tribolodon sp. Also, individuals of Lethenteron (e.g., L. sp. N and L. japonicum) were treated as Lethenteron sp., and they are divided into ammocoetes larvae and adult since 2009.","The three - pass removal method for fish sampling and measurement of stream environmental characteristics was conducted three times a year (mainly June, August and October) from 1999 to 2018.",NA,"No changes or removals.

Between 1979 and 1986, phytoplankton samples were drawn weekly (in winter biweekly) at the deepest section of the lake (M7 in Table 1; integrated from 0.5, 4, and 7m). A detailed description of the sampling strategy is given in Driescher et al. (1993). Since 1987, integrated samples were collected weekly at five different lake stations (see description below). We assume that change in the sampling strategy did not cause a significant bias in the plankton series, as analysis of synchronous zooplankton counts in 1987 (n-15) revealed no significant differences (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney: p>0.1). Moreover, Schellenberger and Stellmacher (1986) found that seston concentrations were quasi homogeneously distributed across the lake. On each sampling date a non fixed concentrated water sample (concentrated through a 5 ?m mesh size) is screened for actual species composition in order to guarantee an accurate species determination in the fixed sample. An aliquot of this concentrated sample is preserved in formaldehyde and stored. Since mid 2016 a photo is taken from this concentrated sample on each sampling date. Cell number and biovolume are determined using an inverted microscope (Utermöhl 1958). We use sedimentation tube volumes between 2100 ml with a diameter of 2.5 cm. We use original Hydro-Bios (Kiel) tubes or tubes following the Hydro-Bios prototype that were built in the IGB workshop. Counting procedure: Transects are counted across the middle of the chamber. If two transects are counted the chamber is turned by 180° for the analysis of a second transect. At least 400 individuals per sample are counted. For large (e.g. Ceratium) and rare species the entire chamber area is screened and counted. Data are documented in a counting protocol according to the programme developed by HAMILTON (1996); Version 3.1 B.
Determination of cell dimensions: Cell dimensions are determined via an ocular micrometer or a microscope camera. At least 20 individuals per species are measured if individual numbers are n>20. Used magnifications are: 200 x; 400 x; 1000 x. If measuring of the third dimension (including cells in colonies) is not possible we use length - width - depth relationships from the literature. For centric diatoms and cryptophytes we assume that cell length equals half of the cell diameter.
Biovolume determination: Cell biovolume estimates are based on simple geometric forms such as cuboid, sphere, cylinder, cone, spheroid (PADISÀK & ADRIAN 1999, pages 334-351). Cell biovolume estimates for e.g. Ceratium, Staurastrum, Peridinium, Gymnodinium are based on a mix of several different geometric forms, which make the best fit to the cell shape. A list of the specific geometric forms used for each species is given in Appendix 3.
Calculation of phytoplankton biomass: The biomass of a single species equals the product of the cell number in the sample and the determined biovolume assuming that:
109 ?m3=1mm3=1mg(specificweight=1g/cm3)=106 ?m3=1?g
The biomass of all single species is added up to gain the total biomass of the sample. Biomass is given in ?g/liter respectively mg/m3.

Lake Müggelsee is sampled at weekly intervals during the growing season and at biweekly intervals during periods with ice cover. Between 1979 and 1986, zooplankton samples were sampled biweekly at the deepest point of the lake (M7, Table 1, Figure 1) at 1m intervals from the surface to the bottom. A detailed description of the sampling strategy is given in Driescher et al. (1993). Since 1987, integrated samples were collected weekly at five different lake stations (see description below). We assume that change in the sampling strategy did not cause a significant bias in the plankton series, as analysis of synchronous zooplankton counts in 1987 (n-15) revealed no significant differences (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney: p>0.1). Moreover, Schellenberger and Stellmacher (1986) found that seston concentrations were quasi homogeneously distributed across the lake. Integration of water samples: The integrated water samples derive from samples taken at the differed sampling stations and water depths (Table 2). In Table 3 the sample integration scheme is summarized for ice free and ice covered periods, and for thermally stratified and non- stratified periods. MPO stands for the upper 0-4m; MPU stand for the lower 5-7 m. Sample number in table x is for internal use only. Co-ordinates of the different measuring stations are depicted in table 1. During thermally un-stratified conditions all samples are integrated into one sample (MPS in Table 3). During periods of thermal stratification samples from the upper 0-4 m depths and the lower 5-7 m depth are separated. The 4m water depths basically relates to the location of the thermocline. We consider the lake thermally stratified if oxygen concentrations decline by more than 20% between 2m and 5m water depth. During periods of thermal stratification an additional sample is taken at M7 above the sediment for chemical analysis. Samples at MS3 and MS3 Ice are routinely taken.
Sample preparation and fixation for zooplankton analysis: Out of the integrated Müggelsee sample (105 L in total; see Table 1 and 2) 20 liters (Total Volume, see calculation below) are screened though a 30?m mesh and the animals are transferred via a wash bottle filled with filtered lake water into a ca. 100mL glass bottle. We slowly add a couple of drops of mineral water (CO2), in order to prevent strong contractions of the zooplankton prior to fixation. After ca. 10 minutes  when all zooplankton have been narcotized, the sample is fixed with 37% formaldehyde to a final concentration of 4% and stored in a 100mL glass bottle. Work under an exhaust hood- as formaldehyde is harmful to health!
The sample bottle is labelled as follows: Müggelsee Date
30 ?m 20 L 4% Formol
Prior to counting of the sample all formaldehyde is removed. Therefore the fixed sample is poured into a net bucket with a 30?m mesh size. The formaldehyde is collected  and disposed. The sample is gently rinsed with tab water until all formaldehyde is washed out. The collected zooplankton is transferred to a measuring cylinder (25ml, 50ml, 100ml). The size of the cylinder depends on the density of the zooplankton in the sample. In all processing steps we control that all animals have been transferred from the net bucket. After all animals have been transferred to the measuring cylinder  the cylinder is filled to the respective volume using tap water. The cylinder volume is noted for the final density calculation of the zooplankton (see calculation below).
Counting and taxonomy: Usually several aliquot volumes of the original sample volume are removed and counted. We use a graduated pipette, with a widened pipette tip in order to include small and large sized zooplankton. We take utmost care to gently but thoroughly mix the sample in the cylinder in order to guarantee a homogenous distribution of the zooplankton in the cylinder.
The aliquot of the sample is transferred into a Sedgewick-Rafter counting chamber (see picture). Surface tension is diminished by adding a couple of drops of a detergence in order to prevent that some specimens adhere to the surface. Animals are identified and counted under a microscope at x40 (crustaceans) to x100 (rotifera) magnification. In most cases several parallel chambers are counted until at least 100 individuals of the most prominent species are recorded. The total volume of the processed aliquots is noted
(Aliquot Volume; see calculation below). Calculation of the abundance: Abundances are given as Individuals / liter (X)
X = Cylinder Volume* animal number in the Aliquot Volume/ (
Aliquot Volume* Total Volume)
Cylinder Volume = Volume of the measuring cylinder (25ml, 50ml or 100ml) in which the entire condensed water sample (20L) is quantitatively transferred.
Aliquot Volume = Volume of the counted aliquots
Total Volume = Volume of the lake water taken for zooplankton analysis (20L).Driescher et al. (1993): Lake Müggelsee and its environment . Natural conditions and anthropogenic impacts. Int. Revue ges. Hydrobiol: 78 (3), 327-343.

This means that all main habitats are surveyed in a representative manner.
Timing and frequency: The survey should be carried out in the main breeding season for the majority of species. Hence the date for the survey will vary across the country (approximately 20 May-5 July). Start time should be 04:00 (+/-30 min), but no earlier than 30 minutes before sunrise. Each route should ideally be surveyed once per year, but each year there are routes that were not surveyed. These are prioritised the following year.
General layout: A fixed route consists of eight 1km-line transects and eight 5minute-points, along a 2 by 2 km square. Line transects and points should be considered as two separate surveys. (NOTE: some routes consist of less than eight lines and/or points. This is the case when lines/points end up e.g. in a lake or the sea due routes being distributed in a standardised grid. However, a particular route has the same number of lines and points each year it is surveyed.)
A given animal can occur on one point and one line, but double-counting the same animal on two points or two lines should be avoided. All birds (excluding young of the year) and mammals (including young of the year, but see the species list) seen or heard are registered no matter how near or far from the line or point they are.
Line transects: Counting is carried out while slowly walking, stopping to listen and watch as necessary, during approximately 30-40 minutes per km depending on the terrain.
Point counts: Birds are counted while standing still for 5 minutes at each point.

    The coordinates supplied are for the central point of each 25 x 25 km square of the survey grid, within which the route is situated.
    Breeding vs migrating birds: The survey person is expected to report all birds seen or heard. This survey is carried out at the time of year when most birds have just started breeding. One can therefore assume that the very majority of birds that are registered are actually breeding, or attempting to breed, in the location where they were registered. There are however some notable exceptions. Some of the species registered do not breed in Sweden, and are instead migrating individuals; for example Brent Goose (prutgås), Greater White-fronted Goose (bläsgås) and Grey Plover (kustpipare). For some species breeding in the far north of Sweden, individuals are seen further south as they are on their way to or from the breeding grounds. Examples of such species are Bar-tailed Godwit (myrspov), Spotted Redshank (svartsnäppa) and Wood Sandpiper (grönbena). There are also reports of uncommon species that are yet to be confirmed as breeding in Sweden, but where its possible that the individual registered was actually breeding at the location. Regardless of which of the described situations applies, all data is included in the dataset, and it is the users responsibility to decide how to use the data.
    Adults vs young of the year: Some birds start breeding early enough for the young to have left the nest at the time of the survey. These young of the year are not normally included in the numbers reported, but for some species it cannot be ruled out that some are indeed included. For the three Loxia species, breeding already in late winter, young of the year definitely constitute a large part of the birds registered. Species with a security class 4 or higher (according to the Swedish species information centre (Artdatabanken)) are not shown in this dataset.

On the south shore the reef slope reaches a maximum depth of 40-60m where the seabed levels off stretching to mainland Honduras. South shore MCEs tend to be extensive patch reef systems, with large areas of reef separated by areas of sand. On the north shore of Utila, the reef slope continues to >100m.

UC is located northwest of the Sapporo station and covers about 1.0 × 1.5 km square. University buildings have been added continuously since 1959. BG occupies 0.3 × 0.3 km square and is southwest of Sapporo station and south of UC. The garden opened in 1886 and includes remnant native plants, patches of non-native plants, and a collection of plants from Hokkaido and neighboring areas.Following the methods used in 1959 (Sakagami & Fukuda 1973), bees were sampled weekly from April to September, 1979 and 1989 for 4 or, rarely, 5 hours each week at both UC and BG. These hourly samplings (indicated as A, B, C, D, and E in the data file) were performed either continuously within 1 day or over 2 or, rarely, 3 days, mostly from 9:30 to 14:30 and, rarely, until 15:30, when the weather was fine and calm. During each of the hourly samplings, any wild bees discovered on any flower or in flight were captured without particular choice. The captured individuals were preserved separately according to the flower species visited. Care was taken to not stay too long at any particular spot. When one spot attracted numerous bees due to the presence of many flowers in bloom, as many specimens as possible were collected at one time, and then other places were checked, without waiting for further arrivals of other individuals. No samples were collected at the orchard within UC or at places where certain bee species have formed nest aggregations. In this study, we tried to identify as many bee species as possible. The study using the data from 1959 named only 51 species, although 102 species were reported (Sakagami & Fukuda 1973). We confirmed most of the unidentified species from 1979 and 1989 this time.

TThe study was carried out on the atoll of Mataiva, the western-most atoll in the Tuamotu Archipelago, French Polynesia (14°55?S, 148°36?W). This small atoll (10 km × 5 km) has an unusual morphology with a reticulated lagoon divided into approximately 70 pools (average depth: 8 m), separated by a network of slightly submerged coral reef partitions (Delesalle, 1985) (Fig. 1). In February 2012, we reassessed coral cover and fish assemblages in the same 13 pools as those surveyed in 1981 by Bell & Galzin (1984). Estimating live coral cover
Bell & Galzin (1984) estimated live coral cover along a single 50 m transect along the perimeter of each study pool, at depths of 03 m. Their estimates of coral cover were qualitative, and they assigned each site to one of five coral cover categories: 0% (all dead), <2%, 2<5%, 510%, and >10%. Bell & Galzin (1984) reported that a subsequent quantitative evaluation of coral cover showed an average of 10.7% (SD = ±9%) for sites in their >10% category, providing support for their qualitative assessment.
In 2012, we estimated the coral cover along three 50 m transects at each site surveyed by Bell & Galzin (1984). Transects were laid parallel to the rim of each pool at an average depth of ?1.5 m (range: 0.53 m), with as much distance as possible between transects. The total length of the reef rim around each pool varied, hence transects were separated by 530 m. Using a point-intercept method, we recorded benthic cover type every metre under the transect line (total: 51 points per transect). Benthic cover categories included: live coral (to genus; mainly Acropora, Porites, Montipora and various favid corals), macroalgae (mostly Turbinaria and Halimeda), other benthic organisms (e.g., sponges), rubble, and sand (following Lison de Loma et al., 2008).
To check the accuracy of the point-intercept method, we also took a photograph of the substratum at each intercept point (total: 51 photographs per transect) on 22 of the 39 transects. The shallow depth of some parts of the transects prevented us from standardising the distance between camera and reef, hence the size of the photoquadrats varied between 100 cm2 and 625 cm2. We placed a digital grid on each photoquadrat and estimated percent live coral cover visually. We calculated average coral cover for each transect by weighting the coral cover of each photograph by the area it covered. The percent of coral cover derived from the point-intercept method was significantly correlated with the visual assessment of photoquadrats (r = 0.91, N = 22 transects, P < 0.0001). We therefore used coral cover from the point-intercept survey in subsequent analyses.
Estimating fish diversity and density
To estimate fish diversity and density, we faithfully replicated the method of Bell & Galzin (1984). At each site, along one of the transects laid for coral assessment, we recorded the number of each species of reef fish within 2.5 m on either side of the transect line. Data were collected once by each of two observers at a 5 min interval. We did deviate from Bell & Galzin (1984) by surveying fish on each of the other two transects laid for coral cover assessment. Each observer surveyed one of these two additional transects.
",Fish were counted using 50m transect lines. Every species observed within 2.5 m on each side of the transect was recorded (size 250 m2). Fish abundance per transect was averaged between two observers. Transects were randomly done within the sites.,NA,MB: calculated area multiplying the area sampled in each site by the number of sites.

At each sampling event, a pantograph was used to record the location and perimeter of living plants within permanent quadrats. Basal area was recorded for perennial grass species, canopy cover area was recorded for shrub species, and all other perennial species were recorded as point data. The data set includes 122 of 1 m2 of  permanent quadrats, although not all quadrats were sampled in each year of the study and there is a gap in monitoring from 19801995. Sometimes quadrats were organized in linear series at the time of establishment (e.g. A1, A2, A3, etc.), with members of a series placed at 1?2 or 1-mile intervals radiating out from a livestock watering point (Nelson, 1934). Quadrats were mapped annually from 19151947. From 19471979 a subset of the quadrats was sampled at irregular intervals. In 1995, quadrats were relocated and sampling resumed at 5- or 6-year intervals. Ongoing sampling (1995present) occurs between September and March. Historical sampling (pre-1995) was typically conducted SeptemberMarch as well, although there are exceptions. To account for the fact that a single sampling event often spanned several months, we include in the data table a column for project_year” as well as actual month and year of the sample, so that data can be grouped appropriately. For example, the 1937 sampling event data was collected from October 1937 to March 1938, and so these data are labeled with project_year = 1937. In a small number of instances during the early years of the project, quadrats were sampled twice within a year. This was done in order to capture differences in vegetation at different points during the growing season, or to investigate the effect of an extreme event (e.g. extra sampling was performed in 1935 associated with an extreme drought). Information on dates each quadrat was sampled is contained in Jornada_quadrat_sampling_dates.csv. Soil sampling was performed only once for each quadrat. Most soil samples were taken and depth measurements made in October 2001. In February 2020 samples were taken to fill data gaps in the 2001 data.

There is a transition from active dynamic dunes on the seaward side to largely stable dunes inland. Ainsdale Sand Dunes National Nature Reserve (53º35?N, 03º05?W) was established in 1965 and forms the central section of the Sefton Coast SAC. It is also a Site of Special Scientific interest (SSSI). The site contains a large area of fixed dunes and dune slacks. The water-table is intensively monitored and rises and falls by over 50 cm in most years. In a typical year, 30% of the slacks are flooded to a depth of 1030 cm, with 10% remaining flooded in the summer. Rabbits have been present since at least the late 17th century when the dunes were managed as warrens. The site still has a large rabbit population, which until 1991 was the only source of grazing. In 1991, livestock grazing was introduced onto the site, consisting mainly of a herd of approximately 200 Herdwick Sheep at an approximate density of 1·5 sheep ha?1 year?1 and graze between September/October and May/June (approximately 200 sheep on 54 ha for 8 months of the year). They are moved around four enclosures and so each enclosure is grazed intermittently throughout the winter. In 2012 cattle were added to the sheep grazing. Mean ± SE annual rainfall is 849 ± 18·4 mm; mean annual maximum and minimum temperatures are respectively 13·6 ± 0·2 °C and 6·1 ± 0·1 °C. N deposition is approximately 13·7 ± 0·3 kg N ha?1 year?1. This level of N deposition is intermediate for the UK and is at the critical load threshold for this habitat of 1015 kg N ha?1 year?1. In 1974, rabbit exclosures were erected in four dune slacks. These slacks were located along a 1-km transect orientated parallel to, and approximately 500 m from, the coast line, with one slack at either end and two located 60 m apart in the centre. Within each slack, three 1-m-high, 1·5 × 1·5 m rabbit exclosures were constructed. In 1991, when sheep grazing was introduced, sheep exclosures (1-m-high, 10 × 20 m) were erected around the rabbit exclosures at two of the dune slacks. These exclosures were impermeable to sheep, but permeable to rabbits. Initially, vegetation was surveyed in one 1 × 0·5 m plot within each rabbit exclosure (n = 3 per slack) and two 1 × 0·5 m plots per slack outside of the exclosures (with the exception of one dune slack where 3 such plots were established). Where erected, the sheep exclosures enclosed all survey plots in the dune slack. Therefore, additional survey plots were established outside of the sheep exclosures in 2009 (n = 3 per slack). Vegetation composition was measured immediately after the rabbit enclosures were erected in July 1974 and then in June/July of 1975, 1976, 1984, 1985, 1986 and 2009. The exceptions were the plots established in 2009 (only measured in 2009) and plots where the rabbit exclosures disintegrated and therefore failed to exclude rabbits or sheep (not measured in 2009). At the same time, new rabbit exclosures were erected in the same locations as, and to the same specification of, the original exclosures. The rabbit exclosures were also successful in excluding sheep from the plots. Vegetation composition is measured using the line-point intercept method. Wire pins (2 mm in diameter) are inserted vertically into the vegetation at 5-cm intervals along a 1-m V-shaped transect (n = 20 pins per plot). The number of times each plant species touched each pin is recorded. The number of hits per species was used as a measure of the biomass of that species.

The first transect route was surveyed between 2016 and 2017, whereas in 2018 the transect was slightly amended to avoid regions with few observations (i.e. a single batoid observation across all 20162017 surveys in the southern part of the transect).
Transect locations were chosen in order to survey varied habitats, as stingrays and guitarfish are seen in both sand and reef habitats, and in habitats with varying levels of complexity. The first transect was 1180 m in length and approximately 30 m in width, whereas the second transect was 800~ m in length but with the same width. The first transect consisted of 51% rocky reef and 49% sand cover, whereas the second transect consisted of 45% reef and 55% sand cover. The maximum depth of both transects was 7.5 m. The global positioning system (GPS) was used to map the survey route and navigation checkpoints. The site substrate (reef and sand cover percentages) was digitized using Google Earth satellite imagery. The survey was conducted using breath-hold diving along fixed transects, with beginning and end points alternated between weeks. Although 2016-2017 surveys slightly differ from the transects of 2018-2022, the two highly overlapp and are suggested as valid for continuous time series (2016-2022) by the authors (see section 2.1 in Chaikin, S., Belmaker, J., & Barash, A.

The traps were located in forests and forest margins (dominantly broadleaved forests). The traps were at the same locations(sites) throughout the study period, and they functioned generally throughout the annual active ?ight period of moths in the region (from early March to December, from sunset to sunrise, using 125W mercury bulb). Prior to analyses, data from years 1972 to 1973, and six other site-year combinations when the identi?cation of species was restricted to pest species were excluded. Additionally, from eachsite, data from years with >10 consecutive days of no records between 101 (c. 1st of April) and 314 days (c. 1st of October) after winter solstice were omitted from analyses (91 site-year combinations; it is possible that such long gaps in trapping indicate breakdown of light trap, not unfavourable weather conditions with nomoths ?ying, and could lead to underestimates in the abundanceand species richness of moths). Finally, the taxonomically dif?cult Eupithecia spp. were excluded from analyses.

The first stations on each transect were located on the forest edge, bordering banana plantations and rivers, while subsequent points were located approximately 300 m and 600 m into secondary forest (bordering primary forest). Net rides were cut as near to the individual points as the surrounding terrain would allow and a run of three 12 m long x 2.5 m high Ecotone mist nets was used. Netting occurred between 0600 h and 1100 h to cover the first few hours after sunrise (~ 0630 h), the peak activity period for most Caribbean bird species (Wunderle 1994).

At each camp, narrow (< 1 m wide) trails were cleared in suitable patches of forest to place five 6m long mist nets, each 2.5 meters high, providing a total netting area of 75m2. Two permanent mist netting sites were used per camp, each one as close to the main survey site as possible. Mist netting was conducted between 6:00pm and 12am, giving rise to a netting effort per site per night of 450m2 (6 hours x 75m2). Therefore, the total netting effort for each camp in any given week was 36 hours or 2,700m2. 
The nets were checked every 15 to 20 minutes during the first 3 hours of sampling and every 30 minutes for the last three.

The Calakmul Biosphere Reserve covers an area of 723,000 hectares, but it is attached to two state reserves: Balam-kim and Balam-ku which cover all the length of the west side of the biosphere. The total area covered by the connected reserves is 1,200,000 hectares. Unlike most of the jungles of Yucatan, the jungle of the Calakmul reserve did not serve for timber production, it was also not turned on for the development of agriculture and it is then one of the last pieces of virgin forest in Mexico. The northern parts of Calakmul have Deciduous tropical forests, where trees typically have a canopy of 8-20 meters height and lose their leaves during the dry season (from December to May), but most of the reserve has medium-deciduous tropical trees (Beletsky, 1999) . The tropical jungles medium-deciduous trees have an average canopy of 15-40 meters in height, although most of the trees are 20-30 meters. The canopy can be closed or partially open, and during the dry season, 20% to 30% of trees lose their leaves (Beletsky, 1999). The dominant species in this jungle are: ramon ( Brosimium alicastrum ), chicozapote ( Manilkara zapota ), ceiba ( Ceiba pentandra ), zapotillo ( Pouteria reticulata ), chechen ( Metopium bronwei ) chaca ( Bursera simaruba ), copal ( Protium copal ), tzalam ( Lysiloma bahamensis ) and mahogany or mahogany ( Swietenia microphylla : Ogata et al ., 1999). 
Calakmul also contains many temporary lakes (aguadas) that form during the rainy season and they can last until the dry season. The fauna of Calakmul has jaguars, pumas, ocelots, 
jaguarondis, tapirs, deer, peccaries, howler monkeys and spider monkeys, in addition to 50 species of reptiles and amphibians and 350 resident or migratory bird species. 
To collect data on amphibians, active searching took place on transects (measuring ~2km in lenght) between 9:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. (for studies of daytime species) and between 7:30 p.m. - 11:30 p.m. (for studies of nocturnal species). These searches were made at a fixed width of 5m on both sides of the transect..

First, the surveyors documented all free-swimming fish whose home range is larger than one knoll and found within 3 m from the focal knoll, thus considered transient for this scale (i.e., Scaridea, Chaetodontidae, Balistidae, etc.).Next, surveyors circled the knoll slowly and documented knoll-associated fish (e.g., Pomacentridae, Pseudanthias, Pseudochromidae). Lastly, the surveyors thoroughly searched for cryptic fish hidden in cervices and between coral branches (e.g., Apogonidae, Gobiidae). Fish lengths (TL) were estimated and recorded in size classes according to the log2 scale (i,e., bins of 2,4,6,8,16,32,64, etc.,).

Routes were then distributed to State Coordinators. These roadside routes were then groundtruthed to determine suitability (not too dangerous, not too noisy to hear) and stop placement. There were 10 stops per route, at least 0.5 miles apart, and located in/near wetland habitats. The wetland habitat was considered appropriate potential habitat (pond, vernal pool, roadside ditch, etc) during selection but the observed presence or absence of amphibians during or prior to selection was not used as a selection factor. Each state established three or four sampling periods to cover the calling phenology of its local species. States used three sampling periods, unless an additional period to target wood frogs was desired. The sampling periods were created to target the peak vocalization times (thereby increasing detection probability) for early-, mid- and late-season breeding amphibians and to assist observers in understanding when to collect data. States were permitted to adjust the sampling dates each year to account for an early or late arrival of the calling season. A survey should have begun 30 minutes after sunset or later, but some began before sunset. Appropriate sampling conditions are based upon wind, sky, and air temperature conditions to increase detection probability. Stops were surveyed in numerical order, in one night by one observer. We encouraged, but did not require, that one observer conduct all surveys of a route in a given year. Multiple observers were instructed to each fill out their own datasheet, separately and independently, if they surveyed routes at the same time. Observers recorded the time, sky code, and wind code, at the beginning and end of each survey to verify that the sampling conditions were met on the evening of the survey. At each stop, air temperature was recorded to verify that sampling conditions were met on the sampling night; at least eight of the 10 stops must meet temperature guidelines. Observers listened at each stop for 5 minutes, and reported each amphibian species heard calling. The 5 minute listening period had no initial waiting period. Starting in 2006, the observers also recorded the number of cars that passed during the listening period and whether the moon or moonlight was visible. The observer indicated whether background noise impaired his/her ability to hear. If there was a major noise disturbance, lasting one minute or longer, the observer broke the listening period to avoid sampling during the excessive noise. If such a time out was taken, this was noted on the datasheet. After the major disturbance ended, the observers resumed listening for the time remaining before the break.

The positions of the transects were established by stretching a taut line from the seaward base of the reef at 21 m depth to the shoreward side of the reef fiat, a horizontal distance of approximately 300 m. The line was run on a compass heading of 110-290 degrees magnetic. This course was along the axis of surge channels in the Acropora palmata zone and normal to the direction of incoming swells as determined by the orientation of the seafan, Gorgonia ventalina, which orients perpendicularly to the swell direction (Wainwright and Dillon 1969). A second line was placed parallel and 25 m to the north of the first. Numbered stainless steel pins (15 x 0.95 cm) were driven into the reef along the two lines to create a series of transects on the reef that resembled the rungs of a ladder. Twenty-one 25 m long ""rungs"" were positioned on the reef between its base and reef flat. Twenty-five meters was chosen as the optimal transect length as an asymptotic cumulative number of species had been reached in trials within 20 m in accordance to the methods first described for reefs by Loya (1972). The careful alignment of the transects insured that we would survey the reef zones and coral abundance relative to their natural orientation as determined by the incoming wave surge and depth (Goreau 1959). The horizontal spacing between the transects varied from 3 to 20 m depending on the density of coral coverage and the degree to which the depth of the reef substrate was changing. Spacing was close at the base of the reef where coral coverage was high and the slope steep. Line spacing of 20 m was used in the relatively homogeneous, gently sloping regions of the reef (see Fig. 3 for reef profile and transect location).
Carysfort Reef was surveyed in 1975 (Dustan 1985) and resurveyed in the summers of 1982 and 1983; it took two field sessions to find and resample all the transects. Transects 1-10 were surveyed in 1982 and 11- 21 in 1983. The majority of the original pins marking the transects were located (33 of 42), which enabled us to remeasure the identical reef coral populations initially surveyed in 1975. We could not find transect pins for two transects on the reef flat, one transect in the Acropora palmata zone (the large coral colonies holding the pins had been physically destroyed), and the pins marking one end of transects 21 (back reef), transects 6 and 7 (fore reef). On the reef flat, and on transects 6 and 7, we found the tag lines we had used in 1975 to find the pins but the pins had been removed. Whenever we could not find the original pin we remeasured the distances from existing pins and reset the end positions of the transects. Thus the transects in these regions were not precisely on top of the previously surveyed corals but were less than a meter from their original positions.
The measurement of a transect began by securing the end of a length of floating polypropylene line to a transect pin. The line was then strung through the eye of the corresponding pin at the other end of the transect and pulled taut down onto the reef substrate. The line was inspected to be sure that it was strung straight between the two pins thus overlying the same portion of reef as in 1975. The length of line crossing over coral colonies and the space between them was measured to the nearest 0.5 cm with a ruler and tallied on a plastic slate. Branching species were measured from the edges ofa colony's branch tips. When branching colonies occurred in thickets, branches that could be traced to a common origin were considered to be part of a single colony. Colonies were inspected for algal infections, physically damged areas, sediment covered tissue, or any other type of blemish. Regions of the reef that showed large scale destruction were examined for debris to ascertain the cause of the damage.

Different consulting companies conducted the fieldwork at the different sampling occasions. The faunal identification for each monitoring year was performed by one of two consulting companies (hereafter called laboratory A or B), but sometimes with additional assistance by other national or international experts. Authors used a version of the MOD-database from March 2013. In Region I, there have been some changes in the number of regional stations over time. Authors selected 11 regional stations based on the criteria that the regional stations should have been investigated at least five times. 
Biological, physical, and chemical samples were taken from the bottom sediments with a 0.1-m2 van Veen grab. At each of 11 sampling stations, five replicates for analyses of macrobenthos were taken each year from 1996 to 2011. Biological samples are sieved on a 1-mm round-hole diameter sieve, and retained fauna is fixed in formalin for later identification. Three additional grabs are taken at each station for analyses of sediment variables. Sub-samples are taken from the upper 5 cm of the sediment for analyses of physical sediment characteristics and from the upper 1 cm for chemical analyses. Sample station positioning employs a differential global positioning system (GPS, accuracy of < 10 m) with the vessel held in position with a dynamic positioning (DP) system.

Two sessions were run (20 min in April and 20 min between mid-May and mid-June), and the highest abundance for each species between the two sessions was retained. Point counts were regularly spaced along the riverbank (15 km depending on the river) to limit the risk of double counting birds moving across a large area, and were strictly identical for each session (Table S1). The final sample consisted of 319 point counts distributed as follows among the three rivers: nAllier = 90, nLoire = 198, nDoubs = 31.
The Loire, Allier and Doubs were monitored, respectively, in 19892011, 19912006 and 19822013. During these periods, the Loire's birds were monitored four times, the Allier's birds three times, and the Doubs's birds 14 times, leading to a dataset of 1,286 bird census counts. In total, 174 species were recorded (present at least twice), of which 115 were terrestrial, and 59 were generally considered as aquatic. Only terrestrial species were considered in the analyses. This was because SSI indices are calculated from the French Breeding Bird Survey (FBBS), which is not appropriate for monitoring local, restricted wetland habitats (species are listed in Table S2).

Here, a gravel beach extends for about 200 m between two cliffs, which prevent shore access to the beach except at low tide and under calm sea conditions. The site is not subject to, or close to, human activities and in 1970 was included in what became Canada's Pacific Rim National Park. The beach was once accessible by a path down the steep cliff separating it from the forested land above, but because of land slips, the path no longer exists and access to the shore is difficult. The rocky, wave-exposed shore has no safe landing site for recreational water crafts, and no fishing occurs near shore. 
 Two series of tidepools, both roughly perpendicular to the shore and separated by about 30 m, were studied. One series of three pools was located in the mid and upper intertidal with the lowest pool at the 1.97 m tide level near the lower limit of the MytilusPollicipes zone, and the highest in the Pelvetiopsis and Endocladia zone at the 3-m tide level. The highest pool in the second series (four pools) was at the 1.22-m tide level near the top of the Saccharina sessilis zone with other pools at the 0.84-, 0.57- and 0.42-metre tide levels (Figure 1). The higher of these two pools, pool 5, was in the middle of the Saccharina sessilis zone, while pool 6 was near the top of the Laminarian zone and tidepool 7 situated within this zone. Tidepool positions, surface areas, volumes and vertical shore heights relative to mean low low water (MLLW) are shown in Figure 1 of the paper. 
Fish sampling was conducted on 13 occasions between 1966 and 2016, whereby sampling can be grouped as eight historical events (19661993) and five recent sampling events (annually between 2012 and 2016). While most tidepools were sampled at each event, in 2016 only two pools were sampled (Table 1). Sampling captured all fish in each pool and consisted of dispersing rotenone into a pool when it was isolated at low tide followed by a thorough search of the pool during which all fish were recovered with small dip nets (Gibson, 1999; Green, 1971). This approach is unique in collecting rare and cryptic species (the full species list for the study period is reported in Table S1). Tidepools were sampled on the same low tide on each sampling date, led by the first author (JMG). On several occasions, the lowest pool (7) could not be sampled because of waves inundating the pool at low tide. Sampling in 1966 and 1971 was with a two-person team, while all other sampling events were conducted by a team of six or more field assistants. Fishes from different pools were preserved separately in 10% buffered formalin and later transferred to 45% isopropyl alcohol for identification. 
We considered how our methods might have influenced our results. First, to understand the impact of repeated sampling, we also resampled six of the tidepools after ~2 weeks (1983) and ~4 weeks (1985). Short-term recruitment results are reported in the supporting material and indicate rapid recovery (Figure S1). Second, these intertidal fishes all have a pelagic larval stage, but both the timing of spawning and timing of settlement of larvae into pools vary between species (Green per. obs.). The timing of our sampling was not always during the same time of the year (May, June and July); thus, we disregarded recruits from the year of sampling in our analyses. Our results are therefore not influenced by years when sampling was done later in the summer, such as in 1993 when surveys were in July.

Macrophytes were sampled during July and August at a subset of crayfish sampling sites within ten study lakes (n = 614 sites per lake) that were selected in 1987 to capture a variety of substrates and both east and west sun exposure. Sampling depths were randomly assigned to sites during initial sampling in 1987 as either 0.75 m, ½ of Secchi depth, or ¾ of Secchi depth, with 1987 Secchi depths used for all subsequent sampling years for macrophyte surveys. Authors followed the line-intercept method to sample macrophytes, using snorkeling and SCUBA to visually identify and determine the presence or absence of macrophyte species along a 25 m transect set parallel to shore at the pre-determined depth for each sampling site. Transects were marked at 1 m intervals, with the first 10 cm of each interval marked by a band of tape. Divers moved along the transect recording the presence or absence of each macrophyte species crossing the vertical plane of each 10 cm band. The line-intercept method allowed us to obtain a measure of both macrophyte species richness and abundance. Because just presence or absence of macrophyte species was recorded, and only at each 10 cm band, our measurements provide an index for abundance and a minimum estimate for species richness. In 2020, the authors were not able to sample macrophytes using SCUBA due to limitations from the COVID-19 pandemic, and therefore excluded a small portion of deeper sites (approximately 2% of total macrophyte sites and 13% of total snail sites) that could not be sampled accurately and safely while snorkeling. In addition, because of a few lost samples, data from previous sampling years were not always available for each site. Consequently, the macrophyte dataset only includes sites for which data were available for all four sampling years (n = 100 sites/year).

Snails were sampled at locations historically sampled for crayfish (n = 24 or 36 sites per lake) between late June and early August. Snails were sampled at randomly assigned depths of either 0.75 m, ½ of Secchi depth, or ¾ of Secchi depth. While the same absolute depths were used in 1987 and 2002 based on 1987 Secchi values, depths in 2011 and 2020 were determined using year-specific Secchi values. Most sampling depths in 2011 and 2020 varied only slightly from the 1987 and 2002 values, but in two lakes the change in sampling depth was greater than one meter due to larger shifts in water clarity. The greatest changes in sampling depth (2.7 m in Papoose Lake and 1.5 m in Little John Lake) occurred at the ¾ Secchi depth sites, whereas the ½ Secchi depth sites were less affected by the change in water clarity in these two lakes. Snails were sampled using methods and equipment designed for each habitat type present in the study lakes (soft substrates, macrophytes, and cobble). For soft substrates such as sand and muck (flocculent sediment or sediment rich in organic material), a cylindrical polyvinyl chloride (PVC) sediment corer (0.018 m2) was used to take a 5 cm sediment core. For sites with soft substrates where macrophytes were present, the authors used a modified PVC sampler of the same size but with two hinged PVC halves, and a net made of 1-mm mesh attached to the top. The two halves of the PVC sampler were carefully closed around macrophytes growing at the surface the mesh net was zippered around taller macrophytes before pushing the corer into the sediment to collect a 5 cm core. Collecting the macrophyte material along with the sediment allowed sampling of any snails on the macrophytes along with those in the sediment. At the waters surface, all cores from soft substrates were sieved (with 1 mm mesh) to remove fine sediments and large particles and picked through macrophyte material for snails. Finally, for cobble habitats, a ring (0.1 or 0.5 m2) was placed on the substrate at each site to define a sampling area. In 1987 and 2002, the 0.1 m2 ring was used for sites with a high density of snails, and the 0.5 m2 ring was used for sites with a low density of snails. In 2011 and 2020, the 0.5 m2 ring was used at all sites. The surface layer of rocks within the sampling ring was gently collected and the rocks were briefly brought to the surface, where attached material was scraped into a collection pan and funneled through a 1 mm mesh sieve to gather snails. Snails collected using all sampling methods were stored in 70% ethanol for later identification. In the lab, snails were picked from all samples and identified to species or genus (for Physella sp.) according to Burch (1989) and Johnson et al. (2013), with revisions for Lymnaeidae (Hubendick 1951) and Planorbidae (Hubendick and Rees 1955). Snail abundance was calculated as density to account for differences between the sediment corers and the rings in area sampled. Snail samples from 1987 were lost in a laboratory flood, but specimens from 2002 and 2011 are vouchered at the Notre Dame Museum of Biodiversity in Notre Dame, Indiana, USA. Specimens from 2020 are vouchered at the Illinois Natural History Survey Mollusk Collection at the University of Illinois in Champaign, Illinois, USA. In 2020, the authors were not able to sample snails using SCUBA due to limitations from the COVID-19 pandemic, and therefore excluded a small portion of deeper sites (approximately 13% of total sites) that could not be sampled accurately and safely while snorkeling.

Consequently, the dataset only includes sites with data in all four sampling years (n = 208 sites/year). Only snails which were alive at the time of sampling were included (i.e., not empty shells).

POINT COUNTS
A point count consists of one person standing in a specific location for a fixed length of time at a specific time of day, and counting all birds seen and/or heard within a specific distance (""Fixed Radius"") or as far as the eye can see (""Open Radius."")
•	CAP LTER uses 15-minute observation periods
•	Counts are completed within 4 hours of local sunrise (see provided table for sunrise time)
•	Counts are done using the ""Open Radius"" method
ADDITIONAL OBSERVERS
The primary observer may be accompanied to the point by an additional observer. However,only the observations of the primary observer should be recorded on the data sheet. To avoid any bias that would invalidate the data collected, the secondary observer should not verbalize, point out birds, or give any non-verbal cues to the primary observer (e.g., looking at a bird with binoculars is a non-verbal cue). The second observer should position itself in order to minimize disturbance to birds as well as to the primary observer. Ideally, the second observer will stand near the primary observer and slowly move around or bend down so that he/she does not obstruct the primary observer views.
•	Please note in the ""Site Condition"" section of the datasheet if an additional observer was present during the count.
•	If the secondary observer sees a species that the primary observer did not see, it may be noted in the ""Notable additional bird species"" section.
COUNT CONDITIONS
•	The first point count should be started no earlier than local sunrise. The final point count should be finished no later than 4 hours past local sunrise.
•	Do not conduct point counts in steady or heavy rain, though it is acceptable to conduct counts in light, intermittent drizzle (be sure to make note of this in the ""Precipitation"" section of the data sheet).
•	Do not conduct point counts in steady winds above 20 mph (visual cue = branches of a moderate size move, small trees in leaves begin to sway). Make a note of the wind condition in the ""Wind"" section of the datasheet.
•	In the ""Disturbance"" section, note if yes or no any type of disturbance occurred during the count, and describe the disturbance under the ""Site Condition"" section of the datasheet. A disturbance may involve disturbing you, the observer (e.g., a homeowner came and talked to you), or disturbing the birds (e.g., a cat chasing birds, garbage truck making lots of noise and flushing birds, predator flew by and flushed birds, etc.).
•	If YOU, the observer, are being disturbed during the 15-minute count period for any reason, make a note of the interruption in the ""Site Condition"" section. Time should be paused for the duration of the interruption and resumed once the interruption event is terminated. Redo the count entirely if you are unsure of the time you were disrupted for.
•	Make a note of the overall noise condition for the whole count period in the ""Noise"" section of the datasheet.
APPROACHING THE POINT and FILLING TOP OF DATASHEET
•	Park your vehicle at >40m from the bird point.
•	Approach the plot as quietly as possible to minimize disturbance to the birds present.
•	In the ""Notable additional bird species"" section, make note of any bird species flushed by the approach in case they do not return during the count.
•	Under ""Notable additional bird species"", note bird species seen/heard before and/or after the count. Bird species recorded under this section are species NOT observed during the count but observed while at the site.
•	Stand quietly at plot center for 5 minutes before starting the count. This is essential to allow any disturbance caused by the approach to settle down.
•	Use this 5-minute settle-down time to fill out the information at the top of the datasheet, set up the noise meter, and find your distance brackets (5m, 10m, 20m, 40m) with the range finder. Note that the range finder MAY be in yards. If so, the conversion of yards to meters is: 5m = 5.4yrd; 10m = 10.9yrd; 20m = 21.9yrd; 40m = 43.7yrd.
•	Record in the ""Site condition"" section any unusual circumstances around the plot, such as construction activity or flooding, or anything you noticed that have changed since your last visit. Also note presence of water (or absence of it) at sites where water is typically present such as at the riparian sites (site code starting with ""EE"", ""EN"", ""PE"", or ""PN"").
•	Record ""Site Obstruction"" as the percent of the horizon view that is blocked by something within a 20-m radius of the point. Record this every visit, even if it does not appear to have changed since your last visit. Record in 5% increments.
CONDUCTING THE COUNT
After the 5-minute settle-down period, set a watch or timer and conduct the count for 15 minutes. Rotate slowly in place and record all birds seen and/or heard. For each observation, note the following in the appropriate column of the data sheet.
Species
•	the four-letter (English name) 54th AOU Supplement (2013) alpha codes if known (see bird list code provided), or write down the complete common name.
•	If the species cannot be positively identified, use the closest taxonomic affiliation (it is better to record something as ""unknown"" rather than guessing). Make sure you look at all the ""unidentified"" code options listed on the bird list code provided to pick the most appropriate code.
Number of Individuals and Distance
•	Usually, a single individual bird will be recorded per line.
•	Only record a number greater than one on a single line if birds of the same species are observed very close together, such as a flock or family group.
•	If a mixed flock is observed, put each species on a separate line and note in the ""Notes"" column that they were part of a mixed flock.
•	Record estimated flock sizes (e.g., ""10-20"" or ""15+"") only if you cannot count them all.
•	Write the number of individuals observed in the appropriate distance columns.
•	If a bird moves during the count, record only the distance at which it was first observed.
•	Pay close attention to bird movement to avoid counting birds twice.
•	Birds such as hummingbirds should be recorded in the distance column if they are using the habitat (such as when they are observed foraging) even if they are not perched per say. However, if you see them just flying quickly by or chasing each other, then they should be recorded as FT.
Fly-Throughs (FT)
•	If a bird is seen flying through the count area below the tallest structure or vegetation, and not observed taking off or landing, record it in the ""FT"" column only, not in the distance columns.
•	See note above regarding when to record hummingbirds as FT.
•	High flying birds can be noted as a FT only if they are ""aerial screeners"" using the habitat, such as a hawk circling 100 feet overhead looking for food. Make a note if the aerial screener is flying higher than the tallest structure.
•	You may note in the ""Site Condition"" section any unusual fly-overs of birds NOT using the habitat, such as a flock of Pelicans flying above the city.
Seen (S) or Heard (H) Columns
•	Record with a check mark whether the bird was identified from sight (S) or sound (H), or both. Use caution with similar-sounding birds like Juncos and Chipping Sparrows, or with mimics and imitators, like Mockingbirds and Starlings.
Direction
•	Record the direction the bird was first observed or heard. This may mean recording a bird heard to the south (S) even though you were facing northwest (N/W) at the time.
•	Use the cardinal and mid-cardinal points of the compass (N, N/E, E, S/E, S, S/W, W, N/W) in this column.
ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS
•	After the count is completed and before leaving the site, review your data sheet to ensure you have filled it correctly: make sure you have a count and distance for all observations, and that the top part of your datasheet is complete.
•	Record under ""Notable additional bird species"" section ONLY birds USING THE HABITAT. This section is to record bird species seen using the habitat, but not recorded during the count.
•	Under the ""Site Condition"" section, you may note species such as Cormorants or Pelicans flying high above but NOT using the habitat.
•	Record under ""Non-bird species present"" any non-bird species observed at the site or fresh signs of non-bird species (i.e., coyote scat) at the site
•	Wear drab clothing and avoid bold patterns that might scare away some birds, or attract other ones.
•	During the count, do not ""pish"", ""squeak"", or use any other methods to encourage birds to show themselves. This would artificially inflate the bird densities recorded and invalidate the data collected. If you want to see a bird you had difficulty identifying, you can ""pish"" only after the count is completed.
•	Use the 15-minute count period effectively; do not spend precious time trying to identify a bird that is far enough so that a spotting scope would be necessary to identify the species.
•	Do not start or continue a count if personal safety is threatened in any way. Notify CAP LTER bird research group managers of any threat to safety encountered at a research plot.
•	If the full 15-minute point count survey cannot be completed entirely for any reasons (e.g. weather, time limits, safety, etc.), the count must be re-done entirely and completed at another time within the season survey window.
DATA AND COMMUNICATION
•	To minimize errors, please review and complete your data sheets within a day or so after the survey, preferably the day of the survey. In between others, make sure you did not leave any blank spaces, review all the alpha codes (if uncertain of an alpha code, verify it with the bird list code provided or write the FULL common name), complete your notes and make them concise, and preform necessary research (listen to calls and/or look at different field guides) to fill in your uncertain identification(s) when possible. The datasheets must be clear and easy to read to facilitate data entry and prevent errors.
•	All completed datasheets (reviewed for errors) must be returned to ASU within two weeks of the last survey completed during that season.
•	To facilitate communication and to aid the supervisor in tracking project progress and scheduling, make at least one entry per week on the google+ project resource page – be sure particularly to note if you surveyed all your assigned sites for the week or if you missed some (specify which ones), report interesting/unusual sightings and specify where you saw them, and report any problems (i.e., site access issues, road closures, safety concerns, scheduling issues, etc).","In a given season, each bird survey location is visited independently by three birders who count all birds seen or heard within a 15-minute window using the “Open Radius” Bird Count method",NA,"Name of R script: ""Warren_2022_TC.R"" FM-added latitude and longitude and plot to the missing records based on data provider survey locations.

A certain shift of study plots occurred during the 20-year period. but more than half of the area was the same and plots usually fluctuated in parallel. The observer went along tracks distributed all over the forest studied recording all audible an visible observations of birds, mostly singing males. Results were expressed in territories per km2. The census-takers of the study plots have also been responsible for the transect work which is performed as follows: The observer goes along tracks distributed all over the 9 km2 of the forest under investigation and records all audible and visible observations of birds, mostly singing males. The tracks were not marked out and therefore their position in the forest may have shifted locally between seasons. This has probably not biased the field data significantly because the observer had to make no less than 80 kilometers, on the average, of line transecting to collect the required amount of data. The size of the area covered by the transects was not considered as the data are only used to calculate the percentage share of each species in the total amount of observations. To estimate these values for the most sparse of the regularly breeding species with sufficient accuracy requires at least 1500 observations (Enemar & Sjöstrand 1967) which in the birch forest takes an average of 30 hours of field work.

N, 78°40? W). At each of 1015 forested sites, a 90-m trapline was established with either one or two Sherman traps at stations 10 m apart. The physical dimensions of the Sherman traps were 7.5 × 7.5 × 30.5 cm, of sufficient size to catch even large rodents, such as red or flying squirrels. Single lines had 10 traps in total, whereas double lines (two traps per trapsite) had 20 traps. Lines were sampled either once or twice a month for three nights from mid-May until the end of August or September, yielding a maximum of 10 of these 3-d trapping periods per year. Over the years a few lines were abandoned or moved, but otherwise the trapping protocol was quite consistent. Lines were set out in a variety of forest stands, ranging from pure deciduous hardwoods through mixed forest to pure coniferous stands. During the early years of the study, three lines in the hardwood forest stands were double lines that were sampled once every two weeks, whereas the other habitats had single lines sampled monthly. In 1979, three single lines were abandoned and the remaining lines were converted to double lines and sampled once every two weeks. The original double lines in hardwood stands were unaltered. One additional line was dropped in 1980. There is a 1-yr gap in the time series (1988), so our time-series analysis and tests of density dependence are confined to the first 36 yr of study. Subsequent population monitoring has closely followed the pre-1988 procedures, allowing additional estimates of per capita rates of increase between 1989 and 1995.
Traplines were ?0.3 km apart and few marked animals have been captured on more than one trapline. The total study area is ?8 × 2.5 km, comprising several stands in a continuously forested region of the Park that has not been logged or burned since the 1930s.
Gross trapping effort was calculated by multiplying the number of lines by trap stations per line, trapping periods, and nights per trapping period. Comparative studies (E. A. Falls, unpublished data) showed that double trap lines yielded ?1.5× the captures made by comparable single lines. We accordingly multiplied the trapping effort from double lines by 1.5 to account for differences in the effectiveness of double vs. single lines. For example, a double line would have 45 trap nights of effective effort per 3-d sampling period whereas a single line would have 30 trap nights of effective effort.","Live-trapping of small mammals was conducted at 10-15 forested sites over 43 years near Lake Sasajewun, Algonquin Provincial Park.

The survey area has been the river stretch from Hestefoss to Jordanfoss, inclusive Cuckoo Bay, Fjærvannet and the bays on the Russian side. The area has been divided into nine counting zones; five to Norwegian side (Zone 1, 2, 2A, 3 and 4) and four on the Russian side (Zone 1, 2, 3 and 4) (see map in Figure 1). The counts have been carried out from small river boats, one on the Russian side and one on the Norwegian side of the river. In eachboat, there must be a boat driver and at least one observer with professional competence. All waterfowl that remain seen or heard, on or in connection with the river, is recorded. In most years, the spring censuses have been carried out by Norwegian and Russian researchers in collaboration, but in some years Norwegian researchers alone have had to be responsible the counts on both sides of the river. Before the counts start, the researchers meet in Bjelkestua at Varlamasaari for planning the work and socializing. This is an important part of networking between researchers on both sides of the border. Censuses were carried out in the river section between Hestefoss and Jordanfoss, includen the Norwegian and Russian sides. Birds were counted from small boats, one on the Norwegian side and another one on the Russian side. Each one had at least one pilot and one experienced observer. They recorded all the birds seen or heard on the river or the surroundings, moving from south to north. In the way back south, they only recorded new species. At specific points, other observers completed the censuses from the shore. Every year, 2 coordinated censuses took place in late May - early June. In 1998 and 2003, the second spring census was carried out only on the Norwegian side. In 2018, there was only one spring census. The maximum number recorded in the two censuses for every species was reported. Autumn censuses were included later and sometimes were only carried out on the Norwegian side. All the counts take place primarily down the river from south to north. As far as possible, the two boats runin parallel to avoid double counting of flying birds. On the Norwegian side, people have usually chosen to go ashore on the headland in the middle of Gjøkbukta to count from land with a telescope. This is to avoid mass transfer and ensuing chaos. The same method has occasionally been used at Noatun and also elsewhere if conditions have made this necessary. After completing the count, the researchers have in some years met at the small one Brodtkorpholmen (Råkoppisaari) for lunch and exchange of information about which birds have crossed the border. This is to avoid the same birds being counted on both sides of the border. During the return further south, only species, or flocks of species, are counted that have certainly not been recorded before. Finally, the results from the two boat teams are summarized in the Bjelkestua at Varlamasari. Then the Norwegian participants go back to the Norwegian side, and the border is closed.","Two coordinated pring censuses were carried out in the river section between hestefoss and Jordanfoss, including both Norwegian and Russian sides.

During the first years of the survey, randomly located plots were selected in the region. Since 2000, plots were selected within a consistent area of 716 km2, referred as the ""core nesting area"" and containing the majority of spectacled eider pairs. Estimates of nest population size for the period 1985-2013 were based on data collected on plots within the core nesting area corrected by nest detection rate. Selection of plots excluded plots sampled in the current or previous yeas. Plot size in most years was 0.324 km2. Two to four biologists searched each plot fo rup to 8 hours looking for active and destroyed waterfowl, crane, loon, and gull nets. Species were identified by visual confirmation of an adult at the nest or by comparing feathers in the nest with a photographic field guide. Loon nests are almost impossible to distinguish an dadults rarely remain near their nests, so the proportion of each species was calculated based on aerial observations. Each year we used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and custom-written True BASIC computer programs to randomly select 85 plots within the core nesting area (Fig. 1). Selection of plot locations was restricted by excluding points that were sampled in the current or previous five years. Plot size in most years (1988-1994 and 1997-2013) was 402 m by 805 m (0.324 km2). Plot sizes were variable in 1985-1987 (0.16-1.66 km2), and were 0.45 km2 in 1995, and 0.36 km2 in 1996.

The detector should be tuned to 45 kHz and left on this frequency, as this will pick up the largest range of bats. The frequency should not be changed during the walk. A separate copy of the map should be used for each evening walk, even if no bats have been recorded on previous occasions. When a bat is seen or heard, the appropriate symbol (see Chapter 3, page 182) is recorded on the map and the walk continues immediately, with no pause to listen for bats. A circle is drawn on the map where each bat is detected. If the species can be identified with certainty to one of the groups listed, the appropriate letter code is added to the left. If a feeding buzz is heard, add a letter 'f' on the right of the circle, and if it is heard echo-locating but a feeding buzz was not recorded, add a letter 'h'; there may be instances in which both suffixes are attached. Bats which are seen, but not heard on the bat detector, should be recorded with a circle and a letter 's' to the right.","The method uses a tunable bat detector to record bats in 1 km squares, noting the positions along a pre-determined transect of all bats seen or heard.

All zoobenthos samples were collected with an Ekman-Birge grab sampler (289 cm2) taking five replicates per site and directly fixed in a 4% buffered formaldehyde solution. In the lab the organisms were identified to their lowest practical taxonomic level under a stereomicroscope. The applied exposure classification derives from an established exposure index for northern Baltic Sea coasts by Isæus (2004). The exposure-classification offers a habitat proxy for the exposure to waves and wind, depth and the proximity to land, which are important structuring components for biological communities. Hence, sheltered sites are generally shallower, closer to land and less influenced by wind and wave action compared to exposed sites.” [Extracted from Weigel et al., 2015] ","In each station, five samples were taken with an EkmanBirge grab sampler (289 cm2), sieved on a 1 mm mesh &amp; fixed in a 4% formaldehyde solution",NA,"Data were converted to long format.

Figure 2 depicts the spatial arrangement of the sample plots in the study area. There was a total of 125 sample plots in five parallel transects. Each transect had a distance of 3000 m to the neighbouring transects; there were 25 sample plots on each transect with a distance of 500 m between neighbouring plots. In the following, the term sample plot” refers to each circular area with an observation point at the centre and a radius of 250 m; the total area of each sample plot is therefore about 20 ha. Depending on the dominant habitat type inside this circular area, the sample plots were classified to the habitat types arable”, grassland”, or forest” (see examples in the Supplementary Material: Figures S1S3). Due to access restrictions, the total number of accessible sample plots varied, but 111 sample plots were visited across all observation dates (Table S2 in the Supplementary Materials). The bird observation datasets for both campaigns are published [15,16].
During the main bird-breeding period, ornithologists with profound local species knowledge conducted bird surveys five times in each year (but only four times in 1999), with intervals of approximately 2 weeks between the surveys. Depending on the variable weather conditions and thus on the beginning of the breeding season, the surveys begun with the first arrivals of the migrant bird species and ended well after the main breeding season. These timings were decided by ornithologists, the dates of the surveys are summarized in Table S13 (Supplementary Materials). All observations were carried out according to the point-stop-count method [17], which involves the recording of individual birds by direct sight and/or hearing within 10 min at the centre of the sample plot. The plots were visited in the morning, starting between 5 and 8 a.m. and finishing not later than 1 p.m. To avoid rough systematic errors, the surveys started at different ends of transects, and the ornithologists occasionally changed which transect they observed over the years. Both bird species and the number of individuals for every detected species were recorded.” [Schultz et al., 2022]","Birds were monitored in two different time periods: 1999-2002 and 2013-2015. In each period, the monitoring was carried out over 5 month per year according to the stop-count-method, differentiating between two distances from the counting point.",NA,"Four bird observations from the period 1999-2002 assigned to no sample plot were removed. Data records from sample plot 1.15, which were only available for one year (2015) altogether, were removed. Day, Month and Year of sampling were obtained from “observation date” and transformed to integer variables. Data of both sampling periods were merged (i.e., the time series has a total duration of 16 y, from 1999 to 2015). Two subspecies names were changed to the species resolution only. All scientific names were split into Genus & Species (epithet). Coordinate pairs for each sample plot were transformed from EPSG 31469 to EPSG 4326 and added to the main data file.

Together with the sustained observations of protistan plankton, in situ sea surface temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a and dissolved inorganic nutrients (silicates, DIN and phosphate) have been continuously measured on a biweekly basis since 1978. The high frequency monitoring allowed the characterization of the phenology and biodiversity of the phytoplankton blooms in relation with changing environmental conditions (Gayoso 1981; 1989; 1998; Popovich and Gayoso 1999, Popovich et al. 2008; Guinder et al. 2010; 2012; 2013; 2015; 2016; 2017; López Abbate et al., 2017; Berasategui et al., 2021); and similarly with the microzooplankton (Pettigrosso 2003; Pettigrosso and Popovich 2009; Barría de Cao 2005; 2011; López Abbate et al. 2016; 2019a; 2019b). It is worth noting that collection and processing of samples have been consistent throughout the study period, including the identification and quantification of species under light microscopy. This high resolution plankton survey has been performed by the same group of specialists, ensuring that changes in the community structure and/or composition are due to environmental dynamics and not attributable to analytical processes. 
Samples were collected at a fixed station (Puerto Cuatreros, 38.50S; 62.20W), a shallow harbor (mean depth of 6 m) at the head of the Bahía Blanca Estuary.  Samples were collected at high tide and around noon time from a pier. For phytoplankton and microzooplankon cells enumeration, surface water samples were taken using a Van Dorn bottle (2.5 l) and preserved in acidified Lugols solution. For qualitative analysis, samples were collected using a Nansen 30 µm net and preserved with formaldehyde (final concentration 0.4%).
The phytoplankton abundance (in cells L-1) was determined using a Sedgwick-Rafter chamber (1 mL) under light microscopy from 1978-2008 (400x), and Utermöhl chambers under light inverted micrsocopy. The entire chamber was examined at 400x magnification, and each cell was counted as a unit (McAlice, 1971). Phytoplankton was identified at species level using a Zeiss Standard R microscope and a Nikon Eclipse microscope, with magnification of 1000x and phase contrast. In some cases, scanning electron microscopy was performed to identify diatom species. The quantification of microzooplankton (e.g. ciliates and heterotrophic dinoflagellates, as well as phytoplankton to contrast methodologies) was done by settling a variable volume (1050 ml, depending on sediment and plankton concentration) of preserved seawater sample in Utermöhl chambers during 24 h. The entire chamber was analysed under a Wild M20 inverted microscope (Hasle, 1978). The units of Abundance are cell µl-1, the units of Biomass are µgC l-1.",Samples taken with VanDorn bottles at 0.5 m depth during high tide and daytime,NA,"Information on day, month and year were obtained from splitting date.

Sampling: Surface (5 m) water samples were taken with Niskin bottles attached to a CTD-rosette from oceanographic research vessels. Water samples were fixed with Lugol (final concentration 1%) and used for protistan plankton abundance estimations.
Water sample analysis: For abundance estimations, subsamples of seawater from the Niskin bottles were settled in 50-mL sedimentation chambers during 48 h. Then, single cells were counted in the chamber using a magnification of 400 in two inverted microscopes: a Wild M20 and a Zeiss axio vert A1, following techniques of Utermöhl (1958) and Hasle (1978). Organisms not identified at species or genus level were assigned to a higher taxonomic group such as Cryptophyta (phylum) or Amphidomataceae (family), or were grouped into size categories such as nanoflagellates between 10 and 20 ?m, ciliates between 2040 and 4060 ?m, and so on. 
Species identification was performed on net haul samples under a Zeiss Standard R microscope and a Nikon Eclipse microscope, using phase contrast, differential interference contrast (DIC) and magnification of 1000 x. 
All protists were counted irrespective of trophic modes, because although phytoplankton are traditionally regarded to derive nutrition through photoautotrophy (e.g., diatoms), some dinoflagellates and ciliates (e.g., Dinophysis and Mesodinium, respectively) and most nanoflagellates (including the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi) are known to be mixotrophic (Glibert and Mitra 2022). Moreover, some dinoflagellates and ciliates are strict heterotrophs (e.g., Protoperidinium and Tintinnida, respectively) and are routinely included in phytoplankton counts. 
For biomass estimation (in ?C L-1), cell dimensions were measured throughout the counting procedure using an ocular micrometer. Thereafter, plankton cell volumes (in ?m3) were calculated assigning simple geometric shapes to species according to Hillebrand et al. 1999, and transformed into carbon content (pg C cell-1) using two different carbon-to-volume ratios, one for diatoms and one for all the other planktonic groups Menden-Deuer and Lessard, 2000.

The undisturbed forest was used as a baseline, whereas primary forest corridors (100300?m wide) were considered a low-intensity modification, with strong edge and isolation effects. Eucalyptus plantations represent a highly disturbed site, as the native forest has been completely replaced by exotic trees. Both modified habitat types have a distinct dung beetle species composition and community structure, mainly by species replacement (turnover component of ?-diversity in Fig. S1). However, communities in Eucalyptus plantations are the most dissimilar to those in undisturbed forest (Fig. S1; Barlow et al., 2010). It is also important to highlight that the Eucalyptus trees are harvested each 45?years. Thus, most of our plantations sites were harvested during the study, we are aware that this activity can strongly affect the dung beetles community but this is one of the main disturbance in fast-growing crops and was represented in this study.”
We followed the protocol for dung beetle sampling in previous studies at same site (Barlow et al., 2007, Gardner et al., 2008, Barlow et al., 2010). Thus, we sampled dung beetles using pitfall traps baited with 30?g of human dung. The traps consisted of plastic containers (19?cm diameter and 11?cm deep), protected from rain with a plastic lid suspended 20?cm above the surface. Each trap was part-filled with water, salt, and detergent. Five pitfall traps were placed 150?m apart along a transect, with at least 500?m distance to the nearest edge in undisturbed forests. Collections took place once a year over a five-year period (20092013) during the wet season in each year. Beetles were sampled in exactly the same locations for 48?h per site in each year. Due to the large number of sites and the extensive area covered by our study, sampling took place over a 23?month period each year between late January and early June. However, to ensure comparable data among years, sampling was concentrated in March and April each year except 2013, when most sites were sampled one month earlier (see Table S2). In addition, sites within each habitat type were visited on each sampling date.
Dung beetle specimens were transported from the field to the laboratory in 90% ethanol, then sorted, dried and stored in paper envelopes. Beetles were identified using a key to the New Worlds Scarabaeinae genera and subgenera (Vaz-de-Mello et al., 2011), a field guide for dung beetles of the Jari River basin (Louzada, unpublished data), and a reference collection held at the Universidade Federal de Lavras (CREN  UFLA; Coleção de Referência de Escarabeíneos Neotropicais), Minas Gerais State, Brazil.

We used the same methodology as in Favila (2005) to collect dung beetles in each forest fragment and pastures. Pitfall traps (11 cm diameter × 7.5 cm depth) were baited with ca. 25 g of human feces or carrion (i.e., fresh fish meat). Each pitfall was filled with ca. 200 mL of 70% alcohol to preserve the collected specimens, covered with a plastic plate to prevent rainfall and leaf litter from falling into the trap. Pitfall traps were set in two groups of four traps per site, with traps spaced out 20 m from each other within each group, being alternately baited with feces and carrion. Each group was spaced out 100 m from the other.

These months were chosen to include the two peaks of dung beetle species richness and abundance in the Mediterranean region (as recommended by Hortal &amp; Lobo, 2005). In each campaign we surveyed 10 sampling sites along the Moroccan road N17 from the Sahara towards the Mediterranean, separated by an interval of around 40 km (Fig. 1). Sampling and beetle collection were carried out under research permits Reference Numbers 01/2013 HCEFLCD/DLCDPN/DPRN/CFF and 01/2014 HCEFLCD/DLCDPN/DPRN/CFF issued by the Haut Commisariat aux Eaux et Forêts et à Lutte Contre la Désertification (Morocco). All sampling sites were placed at least 100 m away from the road margin. Annual precipitation was similar in both years at the three places with available meteorological stations (Saïdia and Oujda in the north and Figuig in the south; www.worldweatheronline.com), although it was about 20% higher in 20122013 than in 20132014 in all three stations. Each sampling site was replicated twice. Replicates were placed one km apart, and consisted of five baited pitfall traps (thus, 100 traps per sampling campaign) separated 20 m one from another following a straight line (thus, 80 m from trap 1 to trap 5). Each pitfall trap consisted of a one l plastic cup (11.5 cm diameter, 14 cm depth) covered by a 2 x 2 cm mesh on top of which 300 g fresh cow dung was laid as bait (see Lobo, Martín-Piera &amp; Veiga, 1988). To avoid any spurious effects due to differences in dung composition, fresh organic-farming cow dung was harvested from a single farm (Colmenar Viejo, central Spain) and well-mixed to obtain a homogeneous dung mass, adding water and mixing right before placing the traps to ensure adequate dung moisture levels. All traps were filled with 300 ml of a soapy preservative water solution with chloral hydrate (10 g/l) to prevent quick insect degradation due to high temperatures and fungi proliferation. Traps were active for a standard period of 72 h (Labidi, Errouissi &amp; Nouira, 2012; Amraoui et al., 2016).

In Mayotte, sampling was repeated between one and seven years at each site (Figure 1b). As a result, 161 surveys were conducted with 12 to 23 surveys each year from 2008 to 2012, in 2014, 2015, and 2017, six in 2013 and 40 in 2016. In Reunion, sampling was performed from one to 12 different years at each site (Figure 1c) resulting in 366 surveys (i.e., 29 to 35 surveys each year from 2004 to 2014, four in 2015 and 22 in 2016).
Fish and crustaceans were sampled using a portable electro-shocker (Deka, 3,000 or Hans Grassl, IG 200). The sampled river length was at least ten time the mean river width. The upstream and downstream limits of the sites were blocked by a net or a physical barrier (i.e., waterfall and weir) to limit fish and crustacean emigration and immigration. To ensure sampling effectiveness and representativeness, two sampling procedures were applied depending on the river width (Olivier et al., 2004). When the river width was less than five meters, the whole area of the river site was prospected by fishermen moving upstream (i.e., complete sampling). When the river width was greater than five meters, the sampling was stratified by hydromorphic units (i.e., cascade, rapid, riffle, run, shoal, and pool). In this case, the hydromorphic units were firstly identified based on mean water velocity and depth following Malavoi and Souchon (2002), and their surfaces were estimated using a laser meter (Leica DISTO D5). Then, several sampling units ranging from 10 to 25 m2 were distributed within each hydromorphic unit proportionally to its surface, ensuring that a minimum of 200 m2 was sampled across the whole site. Finally, each sampling unit was prospected by moving upstream using the electro-shocker. For both sampling procedures, fish and crustacean were captured by a minimum of three operators equipped with hand nets (width 50 cm, maximum mesh size four mm) and positioned immediately downstream to the operator manipulating the electro-shocker.
The abundance of each taxon was estimated based on capture per effort units (CPUE, ind.m-2) whatever the fishing procedures. For the complete sampling procedure, the abundance of one taxon was the number of individuals divided by the fished area (m2). For the stratified sampling procedure, the abundance of each taxon was first calculated within each hydromorphic unit by averaging the number of individuals captured in each sampling unit divided by its area. Then, the abundance of one taxon in a sampling site was obtained by the mean of the abundance in all hydromorphic units weighted by their relative surface proportion in the river site.” [Extracted from Lagarde et al 2021] Additional: abundance units are number of individuals / 100 m2.

The net was fixed to the inside of the canvas with snap fasteners to facilitate the collection of the samples. Samples were always collected from the same location, a section of the river with a fairly swift current and a depth always great enough for the net to float. Here there was always a current when there was any flow in the river. The site was below a 50 m riffle which was regularly sampled to investigate seasonal changes in the benthic invertebrates (Hynes, 1975). Twenty-four hour drift samples were collected at approximately monthly intervals, the net being emptied every 3 h. Night time was from 18.00 hours to 06.00 hours approximately throughout the year with half an hour variation, and the sampling periods were organized so that there were four samples from each of the day and night periods. The catch was sorted in an enamel tray, debris was removed and the animals were preserved in 5% formaldehyde solution. In addition to the monthly samples a series of samples was taken every day for 20 days over a 2-h period at sunset to investigate fluctuations in drift from day to day and the possible effect of moonlight on drift. These samples were collected half-hourly from 17.00 to 19.00 hours. Sampling was discontinued on 19 May when the net broke as a result of the much increased flow on that date. Measurements of the depth of water were made every 30 cm across the width of the river to provide a profile, both at the beginning and at the end of each set of drift samples. From the current speed and the depth profile approximate values for the total discharge of the river and the volume of water passing through the net were calculated.” [Extracted from Hynes 1975 Freshwater Biology, 5:515-532]",Monthly samples of drifting invertebrates were collected from a riffle area in the river Pawmpawm for a total period of 14 months.,NA,"Data were manually transcribed from “Table 1.

The area enclosed by the rectangle of the net frame was 40 cm long by 25 cm wide making 1000 cm2. The net was of nylon bolting cloth with aperture size approximately 0-25 to 0-28 mm, approximately 35 mesh cm-1; equivalent to the number 60 mesh Tyler screen and U.S. Sieve 60. The sites for sampling were selected at random across the width of the stream and along the length of the sampling station but were at the same time chosen for their suitability to the sampler. The substrate was generally a flat horizontal sandstone with some cracks and steps which were more or less covered in the fast flowing sections with moss and various algae. The substrate was scraped from the rock into the net downstream using a spatula. The contents of the net were emptied into a collecting pan containing water from the river and the animals picked from the pan with forceps and rubber bulb pipettes, care being taken to check all surfaces of leaves, moss and pebbles. If the sample contained significant quantities of sand and/or silt the net was first emptied in portions into a number 60 sieve, each portion being thoroughly washed by passing water repeatedly through the sieve and swilling around the contents. The sand and detritus retained were then carefully picked over in the collecting pan. All samples were preserved in the field in 5 % formaldehyde. There was great variation between different Surber samples collected on the same date from the same station as a result of the many diverse microhabitats which occurred within a small area of the river bed. On each of the majority of sampling occasions at least three Surber samples were therefore taken from approximately similar areas of the river bed and in conditions of similar current velocity. In addition to the Surber samples non-quantitative samples were taken with a triangular, aluminium hand net mounted on a long handle and made of nylon netting with aperture size of 0-30 mm. Collections were made by sweeping twice over a distance of 1-2 m whilst scraping and stirring up the bottom upstream with a booted foot. These samples were used to supplement the observations of the quantitative Surber samples. Samples were sorted and counted in the laboratory. For purposes of identification, especially amongst the Chironomidae, some of the animals or parts of them were selected and mounted in Euparal on glass slides after boiling in 10% potassium hydroxide; they were then examined with a microscope. Changes in composition and numbers of the benthic fauna were investigated over a period of 17 months. Most of the following discussion is based on the results of the approximately monthly Surber samples and supplemented by the results of occasional non-quantitative hand samples (Table I). Some aspects of the cycles of change of the fauna were inferred from drift samples, light and emergence catches which were collected in conjunction with the benthic samples. The results from January to April 1970 are based on only one Surber sample (with the exception of 3 March 1970) and therefore are less reliable than those of all subsequent months. Three sets of samples in May 1971 are based on four Surber samples. However, total numbers of animals and the data presented in Table 1 and Fig. 2 have been converted to be the numbers expected or actually coUected from three Surber samples, that is, number of animals per 3000 cm^. The velocity of the current of the river was measured on each sampling occasion at the surface by the simple method of floating a ping-pong ball and timing its passage over a measured distance of several metres with a stop-watch. This was repeated twice and the average of three trials gave a reasonable approximation to the value of the surface current which is in tum indicative of the conditions throughout the flowing water column.”[Extracted from Hynes, 1975] NOTE: the data collected in the sampling events for which 1 or 4 Surber samples were taken are not included due to sampling effort being different to the main period of monitoring. Qualitative samples are also not included. Therefore, this dataset corresponds to the sampling events between May 1970 and May 1971 when three sets of Surber samples were examined.","Approximately monthly Surber samples (x 3) of benthic invertebrates taken in a riffle, headwater area of the Pawmpawm river.",NA,"Data were manually transcribed from “Table 1.

For each transect we used the following protocol: After descending along a rope tied to a pre-deployed buoy,the divers attached a measuring tape to the rope and started swimming. The documentation of the fish started only after 5m of swimming to reduce the interruption caused by the diver descent and preparations for sampling.

Together with the sustained observations of protistan plankton, in situ sea surface temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a and dissolved inorganic nutrients (silicates, DIN and phosphate) have been continuously measured on a biweekly basis since 1978. The high frequency monitoring allowed the characterization of the phenology and biodiversity of the phytoplankton blooms in relation with changing environmental conditions (Gayoso 1981; 1989; 1998; Popovich and Gayoso 1999, Popovich et al. 2008; Guinder et al. 2010; 2012; 2013; 2015; 2016; 2017; López Abbate et al., 2017; Berasategui et al., 2021); and similarly with the microzooplankton (Pettigrosso 2003; Pettigrosso and Popovich 2009; Barría de Cao 2005; 2011; López Abbate et al. 2016; 2019a; 2019b). It is worth noting that collection and processing of samples have been consistent throughout the study period, including the identification and quantification of species under light microscopy. This high resolution plankton survey has been performed by the same group of specialists, ensuring that changes in the community structure and/or composition are due to environmental dynamics and not attributable to analytical processes. 
Samples were collected at a fixed station (Puerto Cuatreros, 38.50S; 62.20W), a shallow harbor (mean depth of 6 m) at the head of the Bahía Blanca Estuary.  Samples were collected at high tide and around noon time from a pier. For phytoplankton and microzooplankon cells enumeration, surface water samples were taken using a Van Dorn bottle (2.5 l) and preserved in acidified Lugols solution. For qualitative analysis, samples were collected using a Nansen 30 µm net and preserved with formaldehyde (final concentration 0.4%).
The phytoplankton abundance (in cells L-1) was determined using a Sedgwick-Rafter chamber (1 mL) under light microscopy from 1978-2008 (400x), and Utermöhl chambers under light inverted micrsocopy. The entire chamber was examined at 400x magnification, and each cell was counted as a unit (McAlice, 1971). Phytoplankton was identified at species level using a Zeiss Standard R microscope and a Nikon Eclipse microscope, with magnification of 1000x and phase contrast. In some cases, scanning electron microscopy was performed to identify diatom species.

Together with the sustained observations of protistan plankton, in situ sea surface temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a and dissolved inorganic nutrients (silicates, DIN and phosphate) have been continuously measured on a biweekly basis since 1978. The high frequency monitoring allowed the characterization of the phenology and biodiversity of the phytoplankton blooms in relation with changing environmental conditions (Gayoso 1981; 1989; 1998; Popovich and Gayoso 1999, Popovich et al. 2008; Guinder et al. 2010; 2012; 2013; 2015; 2016; 2017; López Abbate et al., 2017; Berasategui et al., 2021); and similarly with the microzooplankton (Pettigrosso 2003; Pettigrosso and Popovich 2009; Barría de Cao 2005; 2011; López Abbate et al. 2016; 2019a; 2019b).

This high resolution plankton survey has been performed by the same group of specialists, ensuring that changes in the community structure and/or composition are due to environmental dynamics and not attributable to analytical processes. 
Samples were collected at a fixed station (Puerto Cuatreros, 38.50S; 62.20W), a shallow harbor (mean depth of 6 m) at the head of the Bahía Blanca Estuary.  Samples were collected at high tide and around noon time from a pier. For phytoplankton and microzooplankon cells enumeration, surface water samples were taken using a Van Dorn bottle (2.5 l) and preserved in acidified Lugols solution. For qualitative analysis, samples were collected using a Nansen 30 µm net and preserved with formaldehyde (final concentration 0.4%).
The phytoplankton abundance (in cells L-1) was determined using a Sedgwick-Rafter chamber (1 mL) under light microscopy from 1978-2008 (400x), and Utermöhl chambers under light inverted micrsocopy. The entire chamber was examined at 400x magnification, and each cell was counted as a unit (McAlice, 1971). Phytoplankton was identified at species level using a Zeiss Standard R microscope and a Nikon Eclipse microscope, with magnification of 1000x and phase contrast. In some cases, scanning electron microscopy was performed to identify diatom species. The quantification of microzooplankton (e.g. ciliates and heterotrophic dinoflagellates, as well as phytoplankton to contrast methodologies) was done by settling a variable volume (1050 ml, depending on sediment and plankton concentration) of preserved seawater sample in Utermöhl chambers during 24 h.

Prior to identification samples were rinsed and preserved in 70% industrial methylated spirit (IMS). Using a stereo microscope, all the animals were picked out of the residue, stored in vials containing 70% IMS, and identified to the lowest possible taxon with abundance and biomass per taxon noted. Biomass was obtained using blotted wet weight (± 0.0001g). The individual numbers of each taxa were counted to give abundance data. This was determined by the presence of a head in cases where specimens had been damaged. Any badly damaged specimens or parts of specimens where no head was present were separated into major group debris (annelid, mollusc and crustacea) pots and their presence noted as YES/NO for abundance). All molluscs were weighed inclusive of shells, tube dwelling polychaetes were weighed without tubes, and sediment was removed from the body cavity of specimens of Ctenodiscus crispatus prior to weighing.

In streams lacking productive riffle or run habitat, modified Hester-Dendy multi-plate artificial substrates are used for collecting macroinvertebrates. Artificial substrates are routinely deployed during the reconnaissance visit and a 4 to 6 week colonization period is required for their use.” [Extracted from: Biological Sampling and Physical Habitat Assessment Standard Operating Procedure for Iowa Wadeable Streams and Rivers, July 24, 2015.

SPECIFIC SAMPLES: Hess. The modified Hess sampler is an open-ended mesh-enclosed cylinder. The cylinder is 13” in diameter, 16 tall and has a collection net mesh size of 600 microns. The upstream side is a mesh panel that allows water to flow through the sampler while keeping all drifting macroinvertebrates out of the sampler. The downstream side of the cylinder contains a funnelshaped mesh collection bag. The modified-Hess sampler is most effective in shallow riffles and runs (~0.25-1.5) with abundant rock substrates.” Process the triplicate modified-Hess or Surber samples individually and do not composite them.

Since the program began in 1994, biological assessments have been performed at 1364 locations throughout the state. Over half a million fish and nearly as many bugs were collected and identified during this time. Sites within the biological monitoring program are divided into three major types- Wadeable, Non-wadeable, and Headwater streams. Wadeable streams make up the vast majority of all sites sampled within the program. These are sites that are easily sampled with standardized sampling gear by staff members wading into the stream and collecting the data. Because this is the most common stream type, all Fish and Benthic Macroinvertebrate Indicies of Biotic Integrity (IBI) are calibrated to streams this size. Non-wadeable streams are much larger streams and rivers that are too deep and wide to sample with backpack electroshockers, and require the use of a specially equipped boat with electroshocking gear and large dip-nets. Fish sampling is not as effective, due to the difficulty in capturing smaller fish and minnows in the deeper water and stronger current. Benthic macroinvertebrate sampling is extremely difficult in these types of streams as well. Headwater streams are found at the upper reaches (headwaters) of streams. These are very small streams, and can often be sampled with just one backpack shocker, rather than the 2-3 typically used in wadeable streams. Because the fish and benthic macroinvertebrate communities are much different in the upper reaches, a separate IBI is currently under development.”
There are two main statuses assigned to invdividual sites- Reference and Survey sites. All other statuses are derived from these two categories.
Reference sites represent stream conditions that are least disturbed by human activities, and are used to set biological criteria for measuring the health of other streams within the same ecoregion. To maintain a baseline for biological quality, twenty different reference sites are monitored each year, and each individual site is sampled on a 5-year schedule.
Survey sites are sampled to determine if the stream's biological health is impacted by disturbances such as channelization, livestock grazing, manure spills, wastewater discharges, point and non-point source pollution, and urban runoff. Currently, the biological assessment program is able to monitor approximately 40 different survey sites per year.”
Stream biological sampling is completed from July 1 - October 15 while stream flow levels are relatively stable. The length of stream segment sampled ranges from 5001150 feet, depending on the stream width and how frequently stream habitat features are repeated. Sampling frequency ensures that important habitat niches utilized by benthic macroinvertebrates and fish are adequately represented.”
FISH SAMPLING:Fish are sampled using electrofishing gear. Battery-powered, backpack shockers are used in small streams and a generator-powered, barge shocker is used in larger streams. Sampling is accomplished in one pass (downstream to upstream) through the sampling area. The electrical current in the water temporarily stuns fish swimming near the shocker electrodes. The fish are netted and transferred to a holding bucket or live well for processing. The fish are identified, counted, and examined for diseases and parasites and then released to the stream.” [Extracted from: https://programs.iowadnr.gov/bionet/Docs/About] 
Fish community sampling requires the use of direct current electricity supplied by the electrofishing equipment. One backpack shocker is used for approximately every 15 feet of average stream width. However, in deeper streams or streams with complex habitat that have an average stream width of &lt;15, two backpack shockers should be used. It is important to use as many backpack shockers as needed to obtain a representative sample. A barge electrofishing unit, consisting of generator, electrical control box, retractable electrodes, and a live well, is used in relatively deep or wide wadeable streams which cannot be effectively sampled with backpack shockers.” Fish sampling is normally conducted by a crew ranging from 2-7 people depending on stream size and sampling gear used. The number of crew members required is based on the number and type of electrofishing equipment used. Optimally, for every crew member operating a backpack shocker or barge probe, there should be one crew member netting the fish.” Fish community sampling requires the use of direct current electricity supplied by the electrofishing equipment.

Despite some changes in field protocols and sampling site locations over time, the ASPE database offers a unique set of 47,869 georeferenced and standardised sampling surveys. Fish individuals are identified to species, measured and weighted.” Though preferentially focused on fishes, the surveys also report crayfish data.” [Extracted from the abstract of Irz et al., 2022]
The field sampling protocols have evolved throughout years due to (1) shifts in the objectives pursued, (2) scientific improvement of sampling techniques, (3) attempts to standardise sampling at national and European scales to gain comparability and (4) sampling increase of large river systems (Fig. 3).
Long-term network monitoring of fish assemblages requires standardised methods that provide comparable quality data. All the surveys reported here were carried out by electrofishing following standardised procedures. Two kinds of survey are reported in the database: (1) species-specific surveys (the abundance indexes”, see Fig. 3) that should not be used for the interpretation of other taxa (a taxon not reported does not indicate its absence); (2) multi-species inventories. Among multi-species inventories, complete sampling was performed for small wadable streams with one (single-pass), two, or occasionally three or more passes (multi-pass, see Belliard et al., 2012). For deeper and/or wider streams, several methods have been used, using boats when required; i.e. banks continuous sampling (Belliard et al., 2012), banks stratified habitat sampling (Pouilly, 1994) and systematic point sampling (75 or 100 spots sampled, respectively, for medium and large rivers, see Tomanova et al., 2013).
The length of the sampling point is set to include at least one riffle/pool sequence or two meanders, i.e. length exceeding 12 to 15 times the mean wetted width (variables odp_longueur” and odp_largeur_lame_eau”, respectively, in the Table operation_description_peche”). As required by the European Norm CEN-EN-14011 on sampling of fish with electricity, and to minimise the gaps between the threshold values proposed, the minimal length of sampling point was set after Belliard et al. (2012), (Table 2).
The Table operation_description_peche” documents the conditions of the surveys including the gear type and tuning, along with measures of water conductivity and temperature. Over 90% of the surveys were carried out with direct current.
The elementary sample” (table prelevement_elementaire”) is the finest grain of sound faunistic list entered in the database. Depending on the protocol implemented in the field, it pools together the catches from a set of fish batches and individuals according to different rules: (1) In complete single-pass sampling or in banks continuous sampling, the elementary sample is the whole catch for the survey. (2) In complete multi-pass sampling, the elementary sample gathers the catch for a pass. (3) In banks sampling stratified by habitat, it gathers all the catches in a given habitat strata (e.g. the riffle habitats). (4) In systematic point sampling, a compulsory elementary sample gathers the catches on the 75 (or 100) spots of the design, and an optional elementary sample gathers the catches on the so-called supplementary points” that are not included in the base protocol, but that field operators may find useful to sample because of their fine-scale originality (e.g. tributary outlet, fallen tree).” [This text corresponds to section 3.1 Electrofishing protocols, extracted from Irz et al., 2022] 
Additional: The original dataset was split into 12 datasets each with a unique consistent methodology. In each resulting dataset, the survey methods and survey strategy are consistent across sites. The same site might appear across resulting datasets if the location was monitored with different methodologies.

This dataset contains surveys monitored with: banks continuous sampling on boat and on foot.,NA,"Data tables containing information relevant to the BioTIME template were merged using the ASPE Database package. Species-specific surveys were removed, and sampling points only surveyed one year were also removed. Info on day, month and year of sampling was extracted from “ope_date” (operation date). Data records were checked to be mainly diurnal surveys, with only a small proportion of nocturnal sampling events which were kept. Records with “mop_libelle”==NA were removed. Geographical data projections EPSG:2154 & EPSG:27572 were converted to WGS 84. All location coordinates were checked to fall within mainland France & Corsica as indicated in the data source. A few records (31 sampling points) with coordinates falling in random locations in Africa were removed. Values of sampling point elevation were included when available. The values of area sampled (ope_surface_calculee) for each operation were checked. All taxa records for a given operation had the same value of area sampled assigned. When operations had an area sampled=0 or NA, records were removed due to the impossibility of calculating densities. After this step, a few sampling points monitored with the same methodology only 1 year were further removed. Tables containing taxa abundances and biomasses were added. There were no NAs or 0s in the number of individuals sampled. Thus, number of individuals were aggregated per sampling point, sampling operation and taxon and divided by surface area x 100 to obtain density of individuals /100m2. When biomass (weight in g) data were available for all individuals of a taxon sampled in one sampling point and operation, these values were included. These data were also divided by surface area x 100m2 to standardise the “Abundance” and “Biomass” variables to the same scale. There were approx. 40% of sampling surveys (i.e., operations, ope_id) for which biomasses were not available (NA or 0). In these cases, Biomass is always NA. Taxonomic nomenclature was standardised to the BioTIME guideline: “sp.” and “spp” to “sp”, “Alosa fallax rhodanensis” to “Alosa fallax”, ""Carassius auratus auratus"" to “Carassius auratus”, “Salmo trutta lacustris” to “Salmo trutta”, ""Hybride brème-gardon"" to ""Cyprinidae sp1” and ""Petromyzontidae (famille)"" to ""Petromyzontidae”. We corrected “Atherinapresbyter” to “Atherina presbyter” and updated “Gymnocephalus cernuus” to “""Gymnocephalus cernua"" and ""Leuciscus cephalus"" to ""Squalius cephalus"". We populated the BioTIME family column with the records containing Family classifications (""Astacidea"", ""Cyprinidae"", ""Mugilidae"", ""Petromyzontidae"", ""Salmonidae""). The difference in area sampled for one sampling point across time was checked (the maximum value was 0.26 km2).

The field sampling protocols have evolved throughout years due to (1) shifts in the objectives pursued, (2) scientific improvement of sampling techniques, (3) attempts to standardise sampling at national and European scales to gain comparability and (4) sampling increase of large river systems (Fig. 3).
Long-term network monitoring of fish assemblages requires standardised methods that provide comparable quality data. All the surveys reported here were carried out by electrofishing following standardised procedures. Two kinds of survey are reported in the database: (1) species-specific surveys (the abundance indexes”, see Fig. 3) that should not be used for the interpretation of other taxa (a taxon not reported does not indicate its absence); (2) multi-species inventories. Among multi-species inventories, complete sampling was performed for small wadable streams with one (single-pass), two, or occasionally three or more passes (multi-pass, see Belliard et al., 2012). For deeper and/or wider streams, several methods have been used, using boats when required; i.e. banks continuous sampling (Belliard et al., 2012), banks stratified habitat sampling (Pouilly, 1994) and systematic point sampling (75 or 100 spots sampled, respectively, for medium and large rivers, see Tomanova et al., 2013).
The length of the sampling point is set to include at least one riffle/pool sequence or two meanders, i.e. length exceeding 12 to 15 times the mean wetted width (variables odp_longueur” and odp_largeur_lame_eau”, respectively, in the Table operation_description_peche”). As required by the European Norm CEN-EN-14011 on sampling of fish with electricity, and to minimise the gaps between the threshold values proposed, the minimal length of sampling point was set after Belliard et al. (2012), (Table 2).
The Table operation_description_peche” documents the conditions of the surveys including the gear type and tuning, along with measures of water conductivity and temperature. Over 90% of the surveys were carried out with direct current.
The elementary sample” (table prelevement_elementaire”) is the finest grain of sound faunistic list entered in the database. Depending on the protocol implemented in the field, it pools together the catches from a set of fish batches and individuals according to different rules: (1) In complete single-pass sampling or in banks continuous sampling, the elementary sample is the whole catch for the survey. (2) In complete multi-pass sampling, the elementary sample gathers the catch for a pass. (3) In banks sampling stratified by habitat, it gathers all the catches in a given habitat strata (e.g. the riffle habitats). (4) In systematic point sampling, a compulsory elementary sample gathers the catches on the 75 (or 100) spots of the design, and an optional elementary sample gathers the catches on the so-called supplementary points” that are not included in the base protocol, but that field operators may find useful to sample because of their fine-scale originality (e.g. tributary outlet, fallen tree).” [This text corresponds to section 3.1 Electrofishing protocols, extracted from Irz et al., 2022]

The field sampling protocols have evolved throughout years due to (1) shifts in the objectives pursued, (2) scientific improvement of sampling techniques, (3) attempts to standardise sampling at national and European scales to gain comparability and (4) sampling increase of large river systems (Fig. 3).
Long-term network monitoring of fish assemblages requires standardised methods that provide comparable quality data. All the surveys reported here were carried out by electrofishing following standardised procedures. Two kinds of survey are reported in the database: (1) species-specific surveys (the abundance indexes”, see Fig. 3) that should not be used for the interpretation of other taxa (a taxon not reported does not indicate its absence); (2) multi-species inventories. Among multi-species inventories, complete sampling was performed for small wadable streams with one (single-pass), two, or occasionally three or more passes (multi-pass, see Belliard et al., 2012). For deeper and/or wider streams, several methods have been used, using boats when required; i.e. banks continuous sampling (Belliard et al., 2012), banks stratified habitat sampling (Pouilly, 1994) and systematic point sampling (75 or 100 spots sampled, respectively, for medium and large rivers, see Tomanova et al., 2013).
The length of the sampling point is set to include at least one riffle/pool sequence or two meanders, i.e. length exceeding 12 to 15 times the mean wetted width (variables odp_longueur” and odp_largeur_lame_eau”, respectively, in the Table operation_description_peche”). As required by the European Norm CEN-EN-14011 on sampling of fish with electricity, and to minimise the gaps between the threshold values proposed, the minimal length of sampling point was set after Belliard et al. (2012), (Table 2).
The Table operation_description_peche” documents the conditions of the surveys including the gear type and tuning, along with measures of water conductivity and temperature. Over 90% of the surveys were carried out with direct current.
The elementary sample” (table prelevement_elementaire”) is the finest grain of sound faunistic list entered in the database. Depending on the protocol implemented in the field, it pools together the catches from a set of fish batches and individuals according to different rules: (1) In complete single-pass sampling or in banks continuous sampling, the elementary sample is the whole catch for the survey. (2) In complete multi-pass sampling, the elementary sample gathers the catch for a pass. (3) In banks sampling stratified by habitat, it gathers all the catches in a given habitat strata (e.g. the riffle habitats). (4) In systematic point sampling, a compulsory elementary sample gathers the catches on the 75 (or 100) spots of the design, and an optional elementary sample gathers the catches on the so-called supplementary points” that are not included in the base protocol, but that field operators may find useful to sample because of their fine-scale originality (e.g. tributary outlet, fallen tree).” [This text corresponds to section 3.1 Electrofishing protocols, extracted from Irz et al., 2022]

The field sampling protocols have evolved throughout years due to (1) shifts in the objectives pursued, (2) scientific improvement of sampling techniques, (3) attempts to standardise sampling at national and European scales to gain comparability and (4) sampling increase of large river systems (Fig. 3).
Long-term network monitoring of fish assemblages requires standardised methods that provide comparable quality data. All the surveys reported here were carried out by electrofishing following standardised procedures. Two kinds of survey are reported in the database: (1) species-specific surveys (the abundance indexes”, see Fig. 3) that should not be used for the interpretation of other taxa (a taxon not reported does not indicate its absence); (2) multi-species inventories. Among multi-species inventories, complete sampling was performed for small wadable streams with one (single-pass), two, or occasionally three or more passes (multi-pass, see Belliard et al., 2012). For deeper and/or wider streams, several methods have been used, using boats when required; i.e. banks continuous sampling (Belliard et al., 2012), banks stratified habitat sampling (Pouilly, 1994) and systematic point sampling (75 or 100 spots sampled, respectively, for medium and large rivers, see Tomanova et al., 2013).
The length of the sampling point is set to include at least one riffle/pool sequence or two meanders, i.e. length exceeding 12 to 15 times the mean wetted width (variables odp_longueur” and odp_largeur_lame_eau”, respectively, in the Table operation_description_peche”). As required by the European Norm CEN-EN-14011 on sampling of fish with electricity, and to minimise the gaps between the threshold values proposed, the minimal length of sampling point was set after Belliard et al. (2012), (Table 2).
The Table operation_description_peche” documents the conditions of the surveys including the gear type and tuning, along with measures of water conductivity and temperature. Over 90% of the surveys were carried out with direct current.
The elementary sample” (table prelevement_elementaire”) is the finest grain of sound faunistic list entered in the database. Depending on the protocol implemented in the field, it pools together the catches from a set of fish batches and individuals according to different rules: (1) In complete single-pass sampling or in banks continuous sampling, the elementary sample is the whole catch for the survey. (2) In complete multi-pass sampling, the elementary sample gathers the catch for a pass. (3) In banks sampling stratified by habitat, it gathers all the catches in a given habitat strata (e.g. the riffle habitats).

Following an initial training week at Base Camp, mist net surveys were completed 6 nights per week and took place at up to four different camps simultaneously. At each camp, narrow (< 1 m wide) trails were cleared in suitable patches of forest to place five 6m long mist nets, each 2.5 meters high, providing a total netting area of 75m2. Two permanent mist netting sites were used per camp, each one as close to the main survey site as possible. Mist netting was conducted between 6:00pm and 12am, giving rise to a netting effort per site per night of 450m2 (6 hours x 75m2). Therefore, the total netting effort for each camp in any given week was 36 hours or 2,700m2.

The Calakmul Biosphere Reserve covers an area of 723,000 hectares, but it is attached to two state reserves: Balam-kim and Balam-ku which cover all the length of the west side of the biosphere. The total area covered by the connected reserves is 1,200,000 hectares. Unlike most of the jungles of Yucatan, the jungle of the Calakmul reserve did not serve for timber production, it was also not turned on for the development of agriculture and it is then one of the last pieces of virgin forest in Mexico. The northern parts of Calakmul have Deciduous tropical forests, where trees typically have a canopy of 8-20 meters height and lose their leaves during the dry season (from December to May), but most of the reserve has medium-deciduous tropical trees (Beletsky, 1999) . The tropical jungles medium-deciduous trees have an average canopy of 15-40 meters in height, although most of the trees are 20-30 meters. The canopy can be closed or partially open, and during the dry season, 20% to 30% of trees lose their leaves (Beletsky, 1999). The dominant species in this jungle are: ramon ( Brosimium alicastrum ), chicozapote ( Manilkara zapota ), ceiba ( Ceiba pentandra ), zapotillo ( Pouteria reticulata ), chechen ( Metopium bronwei ) chaca ( Bursera simaruba ), copal ( Protium copal ), tzalam ( Lysiloma bahamensis ) and mahogany or mahogany ( Swietenia microphylla : Ogata et al ., 1999). 
Calakmul also contains many temporary lakes (aguadas) that form during the rainy season and they can last until the dry season. The fauna of Calakmul has jaguars, pumas, ocelots, 
jaguarondis, tapirs, deer, peccaries, howler monkeys and spider monkeys, in addition to 50 species of reptiles and amphibians and 350 resident or migratory bird species. To collect data on reptiles, active searching took place on transects (measuring ~2km in lenght) between 9:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. (for studies of daytime species) and between 7:30 p.m. - 11:30 p.m. (for studies of nocturnal species).

""Consumer plot"" trapping grids were established in 1989 (LTER II) at three creosotebush sites, three grassland sites, three mesquite sites, and two tarbush sites (11 of the 15 NPP sites). Each grid consisted of 4 x 4 rows of traps spaced at 15 meter intervals. Note that methods changed somewhat in 1995 at the start of 1995, and separate pitfall traps for arthropods were also established at this time. Two of the lizard pitfall grids were discontinued (G-IBPE-A and M-RABB-C), and new grids were established (G-SUMM, M-NORT). Very detailed methods that include this change are described in the attached ""dsd"" file and others listed under Additional Files below accessible at the original data source.
Each trap was 40 cm deep and contained an inner plastic container and funnel. A ceramic tile was placed over each trap to close the trap during non-sampling periods. For a 2-week period during each quarterly sample period, the tiles were raised on one side, and the traps were checked every 3 days in summer and once a week in winter. Individual lizards were taken from the traps, identified, sexed, measured, and weighed. Each lizard was clipped with a unique number using the codes on the diagram on the field data sheets. Toe clipping was done from 1989 to 1995. Starting in March 1995 toe clipping was terminated and lizards were instead marked with a black sharpie marking pen to provide a temporary mark to determine recapture status over a particular 2-week trapping period. A black mark was made posterior to the cloaca on the ventral base of the tail.
Traps were opened for two consecutive weeks every month for the period 16 June 1989 to 23 August 1991. Beginning after August 1991, traps were opened for two consecutive weeks quarterly: in February-March (following winter NPP measurements), in May-June (following spring NPP), in August, and in October-November (following fall NPP).
Note that arthropods were collected concurrently with this study, first in the same traps from 1988-1994 (knb-lter-jrn.210008002), and then in a separate grid of pitfall traps from 1996-2001 (knb-lter-jrn.210008001).
Notes about the data:
In early years of the study, there were multiple pitfall grids at some NPP sites that are distinguished by Plot identifiers, and there no pitfall grids at other NPP sites. In 1995, the pitfall grids at M-RABB Plot C and G-IBPE Plot A sites were discontinued and new grids were established at two additional NPP sites, M-NORT and G-SUMM. Also included in this dataset are observations from one additional pitfall grid called C-SAND Plot C that was discontinued in 1997, and from an unknown location (plot values = NA) associated with the M-RABB site (possibly identified as Plot B or BB). It may be advisable to remove these observations from analysis.
The species code column (spp) includes a few codes not included in the original list of lizard species in 'Lizardcodelist.txt'. The NONE code signifies that an observation was made at the pitfall trap, but it was not of a lizard or other species (usually flooding or other problems). SOSE and BUDE codes probably stand for Sonora semiannulata (ground snake) and Bufo debilis (green toad), respectively.
Finally, note that the recapture marking method changed in 1995 from toe clipping to using marking pens. This change is detailed in some of the additional files listed below.
Additional files at Original Data Source:
'Lizardcodelist.txt' is a text file describing the taxonomic codes identifying lizards in the data file (by scientific and common name). The 'CODE' column should match (at least some of) the taxonomic codes in the data file.
'lizrdpit.his.txt' is a listing of notes recorded during data collection. Often they are field notes specific to a particular record in the data file. The 'pc' column in the data file references this file when its value is 1.
'lizrdpit.dsd.txt' is a metadata file created during the time of the study. It contains additional metadata that may not have been placed into the current EML file for this data package.
'pitfall.pro.txt' is a detailed sampling protocol. It applies to early arthropod and lizard collections during this project.
'LizardPro.pdf' is another detailed protocol. It was written after the 1995 changes to the experimental design and is specific to lizards.","Sampling grids of 4 x 4 pitfall traps spaced 15m apart & opened consecutively for two-week long periods, monthly or quarterly, during which they were checked periodically for reptiles.",NA,"Name of R script is Lightfoot_2022_TC.R I edited the Lizardcodelist text file which provides the key for species names, just by adding commas and deleting some header lines so it would load easily.

All three were dropped from data for BioTIME. See curation script for further details.Dropped 5 records with plot equal to NA, as this was the level of data aggregation, and records without plot identified were of no use. I input lat and long as the site centroid of the bounding box the authors provided in the source link. This is slightly coarse at the plot level, but it is definitely a small enough area for the purposes of BioTIME. A BioTIME Plot is a concatenation of zone, site and plot with the authors plot being one of the permanently placed sampling grids of 16 pitfall traps within sites, the level at which I have aggregated the species Abundance data per sampling month to get Abundance counts. SampleDesc is a concatenation of year, month, zone, site and plot because each plot was sampled for a two week period in a given month during which the pitfall traps were consecutively left open and checked every three days or so, note that this was done every month between 1989 and 1991, and once every three months thereafter. Zone is not technically needed in this concatenation, but it provides information on the vegetation type in which a this is also the case for the BioTIME Plot concatenation. Remove records with taxonomic identity of UNKNOWN lizard. Records for one taxonomic entity could be identified to Genus via COMMON NAME variable in original data, which read UNKNOWN Cnemidophorus.

For survey strategies other than “single catch samples”, the number of runs for one given site was compared over time. Because, sometimes, the same site was monitored with different numbers of runs in different surveys, we standardised effort by taking the minimum number of runs per site and disregarding additional counts (e.g. if a site X was monitored with 2, 3 and 4 electrofishing runs in three different years (2000, 2001 & 2002),  we only took the abundances for the first two runs in years 2001 and 2002). This standardisation affects only catch depletion and catch depletion - part width surveys. This step involved removing additional records with abundance=0. Observed abundances were kept. These were initially given as a range (present, 1 to 9, 10 to 99, 100 to 999, 1000 to 9999, 10000+). When “present”, observed abundance were set to 1, when a range, observed abundances set to the mean value in the range, when “10000+”, observed abundance set to 10000.

These were initially given as a range (present, 1 to 9, 10 to 99, 100 to 999, 1000 to 9999, 10000+). When “present”, observed abundance were set to 1, when a range, observed abundances set to the mean value in the range, when “10000+”, observed abundance set to 10000. Total abundances were set to be the sum of sampled individuals (with standardised runs) + observed individuals that could not be sampled.

Sampling Event Date: info on Day and Month was obtained from “EVENT_DATE”. 
Area: fished area as used to calculate densities (i.e., same as sampled area except for the part-width strategy surveys). Surveys for which area fished was NA (all PDC electrofishing) were removed.

Species selective surveys were removed. Sites monitored only 1 year were removed. Zero catch surveys were removed. 
Methods: a few records with the following values in “SURVEY_METHOD” were removed: “NOT RECORDED”, “POISON”, “POLLUTION”, “Beam Trawl Netting 1.5m”, “DIP NETTING”, “DRAINING”, “INTAKE SCREEN SAMPLING”. These were removed since the methods were not employed through time in one given site.

New records for three new sampling periods (years 2007, 2012 and 2017) were added in 2023.
General: the data files for each year of sampling were appended, and year was added as a temporal identifier of sampling event. No data from the first year of sampling (i.e. 1965) were included because the sampling effort was different relative to the rest of the time series (i.e. in 1965 trees were monitored in subplots of 10m x 10m within each of the 208 25m x 25m, and all trees >=1.5 cm dbh were included too). In R, it was checked that tres of >=10cm dbh were included in the inventory from 1977. The records of dead trees reported for each year (vigor codes = 4, 5 & 6) were removed.

Records identified as ""UNKN"", i.e. “unknown, used for unidentifiable rotten snags” were removed. The family of each species was searched and added. As a measure of biomass, aboveground biomass was selected, but below ground biomass is also availble in the original data files (see references). The centroid of the bounding coordinates for the watershed was used as a central coordinate pair for all observations. Unique “Seq” (i.e. sequence) which is defined as “the unique number for each tree; multiple stems of same tree have same sequence” was used to count the numbers of individuals of each species per year. Study-specific:  curation steps were taken to standardize differences in sample effort over the two years of sampling. It was checked that trees had been monitored in the same 25 x 25 m plots both years. The data for three plots monitored in 1987 but not in 1982 (plots 22, 32 & 61) was removed to standardize the overall area sampled in both years.

The watershed 6 in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (13.23 ha), is divided in 208 25 m x 25 m plots. Trees &gt;=2 to &lt;=10 cm dbh were subsampled using a 3 meter wide strip along one edge of each 25 m x 25 m plot from 1992 to 2017. The lengths of these strips are not always exactly 25 meters, due to drift or imprecise replacement of the corner stakes. The actual measured length of the strip is used to calculate the area of the plot (as given in the data) for the smaller trees. All stems that met the size criteria were measured individually, and in some years it was noted whether a stem was part of a group of stems from the same tree (i.e. multiple stems that split from a single trunk below breast height).

All sites are identified with GPS coordinates, except on the bog lakes (Trout Bog and Crystal Bog) where nets are placed equal distances apart around the entire circumference of the lake in approximately the same locations each year.
A boom style electrofishing system is used to sample the littoral zone fish community. Prior to 1997, four electrofishing transects were done on each lake. In 1997, the number of transects was reduced to 3. The same transects are used each year. Each transect consists of 30 minutes of current output, with the boat moving parallel to shore in 1-2 meters of water at a slow steady speed. We use the DC pulse system, with 240 volts at 3-5 amps. Transect lengths vary depending upon the size of the lake. If the end of a transect is reached before 30 minutes has elapsed, time is paused while the electrofisher loops back to the start of the transect. The transect is then repeated for the remaining time.
Abundance is Catch per unit effort, so the total yearly catches have been divided by effort. This data is only referring to Electrofishing catches and it's part of the North Temperate Lakes LTER sampling. For electrofishing sampling, effort is given by the number of transect made, so abundance as Catch Per Unit Effort is the total  yearly catch divided by the number of transects performed each year.

Throats 10 cm in diameter are located between the second and third hoops. The net ends in a bag with a 20.4 cm opening at the end, which is tied shut while the net is fishing. New nets of the same dimensions were purchased for the Northern Highland lakes in 2000. Fyke nets for the Madison lakes are 10 m long (including lead) with 1 rectangular aluminum frame followed by 2 aluminum hoops. The aluminum frame is 98 cm wide x 82 cm tall, and is constructed of 2.5 cm tubing, with an additional center vertical bar. The hoops are 60 cm in diameter and constructed of 5 mm diameter aluminum rod. The single net funnel is between the first and second hoops and is 20 cm in diameter. The lead is 8 m long and 1.25m deep, constructed from 7mm delta stretch mesh.
Abundance is Catch per unit effort, so the total yearly catches have been divided by effort. This data is only referring to Fyke nets' catches and it's part of the North Temperate Lakes LTER sampling. For Fyke nets sampling, effort is given by the number of nets used, so abundance as Catch Per Unit Effort is the total  yearly catch divided by the number of nets deployed and recollected each year.

Dataset methods
Sample collection via 20um net and 12m x 30mm snake preserved with Lugols and identified with light microscopy
Database methods
Sampling was done via research vessels container ships and small boats by experienced researchers students and volunteers. The majority of the samples were preserved using Lugol?s solution although formalin paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde have also been used. Different methods of preservation can affect the condition of the sample and which taxa are well preserved 417. Samples were analysed with standard methods including light microscopy transmission or scanning electron microscopy which are described in Hallegraeff et al. All methodological variations within our phytoplankton database are detailed in the metadata where available and recorded for each data entry. 
Where available a citation is referenced for each project which gives details on methodologies and limitations from that project (Table 1). There were three stages in data gathering. The first stage was to conduct a literature review of Australian phytoplankton data. Any literature that contained abundance or presence data was digitised and uploaded into the CSIRO maintained Oracle database. The second stage was to scan already existing databases such as the CSIRO data trawler the Ocean Biogeographic Ocean System (OBIS) and the Atlas of Living Australia (AOLA). These repositories only store presence records. Relevant data were selected and uploaded into the database. The third stage was to ask researchers to contribute any other data sets that they had. All data were organised into a standard format and uploaded into the database. Data were then served to and hosted by the AODN. 
Taxa methods
All taxa have been verified as accepted species and given the currently accepted name as defined by the World Register of Marine Species database (WoRMS -http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=webservice). If any taxa could not be verified then a second check was done through AlgaeBase (http://www.algaebase.org/). If this did not verify that taxa as a valid name then the taxonomic level of identification was decreased to a satisfactory level or the entry removed. All abundance values were standardised to cells.L-1 or are given as presence only. Records of the original identifications and units were archived so any records can be checked. Identification of the smaller phytoplankton is often to a coarser taxonomic level as many cannot be distinguished to species using light microscopy. In some studies electron microscopy has been used to determine species but in other studies functional groups have been identified. Cell biovolume is calculated as per Hillebrand et al. 19 following the suggested shape factors for each genera. Size parameters were estimated from measurements taken from Australian samples or Australian references where available420 and other sources where not21-23. In some data sets direct measurements of size classes (e.g. P599 the Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey and P597 the IMOS National Reference Stations) were used in preference to literature values. For some taxa there was insufficient information available to estimate a biovolume these were generally the rare taxa. Rather than estimate a size class without any information available these have been left blank. 
Data Records
Each data record represents the abundance or presence of a phytoplankton taxa at a certain point in space and time and has been given a unique record identification number P(project_id)_(sample_id)_(record_id). Each data record belongs to a project with each project having a unique identification number Pxxx. A project is defined as a set of data records which have been collected together usually as a cruise or study with the same sampling method and having the same person counting the samples. Metadata ascribed to a project relates to all the data records within that project. Details to identify each separate project are given in Table 1. Each sample within that project has a unique sample_id. The sample_id has not been changed from the original data set to maintain traceability. So these may be duplicated between projects but P(project_id)_(sample_id) will be a unique entity in space and time. Species abundance records within the sample are given a unique record_id.
Technical Validation
The Phytoplankton Database will provide an extensive resource for phytoplankton researchers although there are some caveats due to the variety of the sampling and analysis protocols. The various sample collection methods infer that abundances might not always be directlycomparable across projects. For example quantitative methods such as bottle sampling (e.g. Project 599) will collect all but the rarest phytoplankton and will include the whole size spectrum whereas semi-quantitative methods such as net sampling are selective and dependent on tow method mesh size and the mix of species present in the water as some species may clog the net and trap smaller species that would otherwise go through the mesh (e.g. Project 509)21. By including all data collected using different methods and including this information as meta-data researchers are able to analyse the relative abundance of each taxa within a project and compare across compatible projects. Metadata includes as much detail as is available about sampling methods and limitations and provides guidance to the users about the potential of each data set. Users should consider collection methods preservation techniques and microscopic limitations when comparing datasets. All datasets have been standardised to taxa/m3 of water except P1070 where the units are taxa per gram of substrate measured. This project collected the phytoplankton by collecting substrates and analysing parts of the substrate. It is included here as the only data set on Gambierdiscus and associated benthic dinoflagellates from Australia which are important to the studies of the ciguatera. All datasets submitted can be interpreted as confirming the presence of those species recorded. In some datasets e.g. time series it is possible also to infer absences assuming that all species are looked for on each sampling occasion. Absences have been included in the data sets where the project information available allowed us the confidence to interpret such absences correctly. The interpretation of absences from other projects is at the discretion of the user. We suggest that a project-by-project approach should be taken. If a taxa is notobserved at all in a project then the absence could be due to the taxa not being present that taxa not being of interest to the analyst or the inability to identify that taxa. Thus a real absence should not be inferred. If a taxa is observed in some samples of a project it can most likely be assumed that the microscopist could identify the taxa and that a real absence may be inferred in samples within that project where the taxa was not marked as present. Some data records were removed when there was ambiguity as to the identification of the taxa i.e. when the taxonomic traceability usually from older sources was confused or whenspelling mistakes make it unclear which one of two species was meant. Species known as freshwater species were removed as the methods used to collect data were not aimed at freshwater environments and the inclusion of the odd records of these species would not be comprehensive or meaningful. Estuarine species were captured and the records kept. Data records with positions on land with an unreal number for abundance or with impossible dates were also removed or converted to presence records.
Usage Notes
The database contains information on the functional group of the species which can aid analysis. Functional groups include diatoms dinoflagellates flagellates ciliates (including tintinnids) silicoflagellates and cyanobacteria. Once downloaded and binned as required data are suitable for use in the creation of ecological indicators. For example: ? Total diatoms dinoflagellates ? Diatom:Dinoflagellate ratio ? Total phytoplankton abundance or biomass per degree square. Abundance (cells.L-1) for the phytoplankton counts is given where it is available providing more information about the productivity of an area than presence data alone. A low cell abundance may indicate a low level or production but this may not be the case if these are large cells. The biomass data helps to show productivity of an area. The biovolume has been calculated for each cell count and when converted to biomass is available for use by modellers and to assist in interpretation of an area?s productivity. An accepted method of converting biovolume to biomass is to assume that the cell has the density of water (1 mm3 .L-1 = 1 mg.L- 1 ) 13. Another useful conversion is to carbon biomass; full methods are readily found in the literature24-26. Table 2 gives details conversions of phytoplankton size data to carbon biomass. Some of the data records are missing dates or coordinates. It was considered useful to keep these records as the presence of a taxa in a location may still be of value. The user may estimate coordinates from the location given and would then also be aware that these would not be the exact coordinates of the sample. Data can be analysed in many different ways and in many software applications (e.g. R Matlab). The list of citations referenced in Table 1 will also give users information as to how this data has been previously used from the discrete projects.

Another useful conversion is to carbon biomass; full methods are readily found in the literature24-26. Table 2 gives details conversions of phytoplankton size data to carbon biomass. Some of the data records are missing dates or coordinates. It was considered useful to keep these records as the presence of a taxa in a location may still be of value.

Dataset methods
Sample collection via 1L bottle preserved with Lugols and identified with light microscopy. 
Database methods
Sampling was done via research vessels container ships and small boats by experienced researchers students and volunteers. The majority of the samples were preserved using Lugol?s solution although formalin paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde have also been used. Different methods of preservation can affect the condition of the sample and which taxa are well preserved 417. Samples were analysed with standard methods including light microscopy transmission or scanning electron microscopy which are described in Hallegraeff et al. All methodological variations within our phytoplankton database are detailed in the metadata where available and recorded for each data entry. 
Where available a citation is referenced for each project which gives details on methodologies and limitations from that project (Table 1). There were three stages in data gathering. The first stage was to conduct a literature review of Australian phytoplankton data. Any literature that contained abundance or presence data was digitised and uploaded into the CSIRO maintained Oracle database. The second stage was to scan already existing databases such as the CSIRO data trawler the Ocean Biogeographic Ocean System (OBIS) and the Atlas of Living Australia (AOLA). These repositories only store presence records. Relevant data were selected and uploaded into the database. The third stage was to ask researchers to contribute any other data sets that they had. All data were organised into a standard format and uploaded into the database. Data were then served to and hosted by the AODN. 
Taxa methods
All taxa have been verified as accepted species and given the currently accepted name as defined by the World Register of Marine Species database (WoRMS -http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=webservice). If any taxa could not be verified then a second check was done through AlgaeBase (http://www.algaebase.org/). If this did not verify that taxa as a valid name then the taxonomic level of identification was decreased to a satisfactory level or the entry removed. All abundance values were standardised to cells.L-1 or are given as presence only. Records of the original identifications and units were archived so any records can be checked. Identification of the smaller phytoplankton is often to a coarser taxonomic level as many cannot be distinguished to species using light microscopy. In some studies electron microscopy has been used to determine species but in other studies functional groups have been identified. Cell biovolume is calculated as per Hillebrand et al. 19 following the suggested shape factors for each genera. Size parameters were estimated from measurements taken from Australian samples or Australian references where available420 and other sources where not21-23. In some data sets direct measurements of size classes (e.g. P599 the Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey and P597 the IMOS National Reference Stations) were used in preference to literature values. For some taxa there was insufficient information available to estimate a biovolume these were generally the rare taxa. Rather than estimate a size class without any information available these have been left blank. 
Data Records
Each data record represents the abundance or presence of a phytoplankton taxa at a certain point in space and time and has been given a unique record identification number P(project_id)_(sample_id)_(record_id). Each data record belongs to a project with each project having a unique identification number Pxxx. A project is defined as a set of data records which have been collected together usually as a cruise or study with the same sampling method and having the same person counting the samples. Metadata ascribed to a project relates to all the data records within that project. Details to identify each separate project are given in Table 1. Each sample within that project has a unique sample_id. The sample_id has not been changed from the original data set to maintain traceability. So these may be duplicated between projects but P(project_id)_(sample_id) will be a unique entity in space and time. Species abundance records within the sample are given a unique record_id.
Technical Validation
The Phytoplankton Database will provide an extensive resource for phytoplankton researchers although there are some caveats due to the variety of the sampling and analysis protocols. The various sample collection methods infer that abundances might not always be directlycomparable across projects. For example quantitative methods such as bottle sampling (e.g. Project 599) will collect all but the rarest phytoplankton and will include the whole size spectrum whereas semi-quantitative methods such as net sampling are selective and dependent on tow method mesh size and the mix of species present in the water as some species may clog the net and trap smaller species that would otherwise go through the mesh (e.g. Project 509)21. By including all data collected using different methods and including this information as meta-data researchers are able to analyse the relative abundance of each taxa within a project and compare across compatible projects. Metadata includes as much detail as is available about sampling methods and limitations and provides guidance to the users about the potential of each data set. Users should consider collection methods preservation techniques and microscopic limitations when comparing datasets. All datasets have been standardised to taxa/m3 of water except P1070 where the units are taxa per gram of substrate measured. This project collected the phytoplankton by collecting substrates and analysing parts of the substrate. It is included here as the only data set on Gambierdiscus and associated benthic dinoflagellates from Australia which are important to the studies of the ciguatera. All datasets submitted can be interpreted as confirming the presence of those species recorded. In some datasets e.g. time series it is possible also to infer absences assuming that all species are looked for on each sampling occasion. Absences have been included in the data sets where the project information available allowed us the confidence to interpret such absences correctly. The interpretation of absences from other projects is at the discretion of the user. We suggest that a project-by-project approach should be taken. If a taxa is notobserved at all in a project then the absence could be due to the taxa not being present that taxa not being of interest to the analyst or the inability to identify that taxa. Thus a real absence should not be inferred. If a taxa is observed in some samples of a project it can most likely be assumed that the microscopist could identify the taxa and that a real absence may be inferred in samples within that project where the taxa was not marked as present. Some data records were removed when there was ambiguity as to the identification of the taxa i.e. when the taxonomic traceability usually from older sources was confused or whenspelling mistakes make it unclear which one of two species was meant. Species known as freshwater species were removed as the methods used to collect data were not aimed at freshwater environments and the inclusion of the odd records of these species would not be comprehensive or meaningful. Estuarine species were captured and the records kept. Data records with positions on land with an unreal number for abundance or with impossible dates were also removed or converted to presence records.
Usage Notes
The database contains information on the functional group of the species which can aid analysis. Functional groups include diatoms dinoflagellates flagellates ciliates (including tintinnids) silicoflagellates and cyanobacteria. Once downloaded and binned as required data are suitable for use in the creation of ecological indicators. For example: ? Total diatoms dinoflagellates ? Diatom:Dinoflagellate ratio ? Total phytoplankton abundance or biomass per degree square. Abundance (cells.L-1) for the phytoplankton counts is given where it is available providing more information about the productivity of an area than presence data alone. A low cell abundance may indicate a low level or production but this may not be the case if these are large cells. The biomass data helps to show productivity of an area. The biovolume has been calculated for each cell count and when converted to biomass is available for use by modellers and to assist in interpretation of an area?s productivity.

Dataset methods
Sample collection via 10m tube preserved with Lugols and identified with light microscopy
Database methods
Sampling was done via research vessels container ships and small boats by experienced researchers students and volunteers. The majority of the samples were preserved using Lugol?s solution although formalin paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde have also been used. Different methods of preservation can affect the condition of the sample and which taxa are well preserved 417. Samples were analysed with standard methods including light microscopy transmission or scanning electron microscopy which are described in Hallegraeff et al. All methodological variations within our phytoplankton database are detailed in the metadata where available and recorded for each data entry. 
Where available a citation is referenced for each project which gives details on methodologies and limitations from that project (Table 1). There were three stages in data gathering. The first stage was to conduct a literature review of Australian phytoplankton data. Any literature that contained abundance or presence data was digitised and uploaded into the CSIRO maintained Oracle database. The second stage was to scan already existing databases such as the CSIRO data trawler the Ocean Biogeographic Ocean System (OBIS) and the Atlas of Living Australia (AOLA). These repositories only store presence records. Relevant data were selected and uploaded into the database. The third stage was to ask researchers to contribute any other data sets that they had. All data were organised into a standard format and uploaded into the database. Data were then served to and hosted by the AODN. 
Taxa methods
All taxa have been verified as accepted species and given the currently accepted name as defined by the World Register of Marine Species database (WoRMS -http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=webservice). If any taxa could not be verified then a second check was done through AlgaeBase (http://www.algaebase.org/). If this did not verify that taxa as a valid name then the taxonomic level of identification was decreased to a satisfactory level or the entry removed. All abundance values were standardised to cells.L-1 or are given as presence only. Records of the original identifications and units were archived so any records can be checked. Identification of the smaller phytoplankton is often to a coarser taxonomic level as many cannot be distinguished to species using light microscopy. In some studies electron microscopy has been used to determine species but in other studies functional groups have been identified. Cell biovolume is calculated as per Hillebrand et al. 19 following the suggested shape factors for each genera. Size parameters were estimated from measurements taken from Australian samples or Australian references where available420 and other sources where not21-23. In some data sets direct measurements of size classes (e.g. P599 the Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey and P597 the IMOS National Reference Stations) were used in preference to literature values. For some taxa there was insufficient information available to estimate a biovolume these were generally the rare taxa. Rather than estimate a size class without any information available these have been left blank. 
Data Records
Each data record represents the abundance or presence of a phytoplankton taxa at a certain point in space and time and has been given a unique record identification number P(project_id)_(sample_id)_(record_id). Each data record belongs to a project with each project having a unique identification number Pxxx. A project is defined as a set of data records which have been collected together usually as a cruise or study with the same sampling method and having the same person counting the samples. Metadata ascribed to a project relates to all the data records within that project. Details to identify each separate project are given in Table 1. Each sample within that project has a unique sample_id. The sample_id has not been changed from the original data set to maintain traceability. So these may be duplicated between projects but P(project_id)_(sample_id) will be a unique entity in space and time. Species abundance records within the sample are given a unique record_id.
Technical Validation
The Phytoplankton Database will provide an extensive resource for phytoplankton researchers although there are some caveats due to the variety of the sampling and analysis protocols. The various sample collection methods infer that abundances might not always be directlycomparable across projects. For example quantitative methods such as bottle sampling (e.g. Project 599) will collect all but the rarest phytoplankton and will include the whole size spectrum whereas semi-quantitative methods such as net sampling are selective and dependent on tow method mesh size and the mix of species present in the water as some species may clog the net and trap smaller species that would otherwise go through the mesh (e.g. Project 509)21. By including all data collected using different methods and including this information as meta-data researchers are able to analyse the relative abundance of each taxa within a project and compare across compatible projects. Metadata includes as much detail as is available about sampling methods and limitations and provides guidance to the users about the potential of each data set. Users should consider collection methods preservation techniques and microscopic limitations when comparing datasets. All datasets have been standardised to taxa/m3 of water except P1070 where the units are taxa per gram of substrate measured. This project collected the phytoplankton by collecting substrates and analysing parts of the substrate. It is included here as the only data set on Gambierdiscus and associated benthic dinoflagellates from Australia which are important to the studies of the ciguatera. All datasets submitted can be interpreted as confirming the presence of those species recorded. In some datasets e.g. time series it is possible also to infer absences assuming that all species are looked for on each sampling occasion. Absences have been included in the data sets where the project information available allowed us the confidence to interpret such absences correctly. The interpretation of absences from other projects is at the discretion of the user. We suggest that a project-by-project approach should be taken. If a taxa is notobserved at all in a project then the absence could be due to the taxa not being present that taxa not being of interest to the analyst or the inability to identify that taxa. Thus a real absence should not be inferred. If a taxa is observed in some samples of a project it can most likely be assumed that the microscopist could identify the taxa and that a real absence may be inferred in samples within that project where the taxa was not marked as present. Some data records were removed when there was ambiguity as to the identification of the taxa i.e. when the taxonomic traceability usually from older sources was confused or whenspelling mistakes make it unclear which one of two species was meant. Species known as freshwater species were removed as the methods used to collect data were not aimed at freshwater environments and the inclusion of the odd records of these species would not be comprehensive or meaningful. Estuarine species were captured and the records kept. Data records with positions on land with an unreal number for abundance or with impossible dates were also removed or converted to presence records.
Usage Notes
The database contains information on the functional group of the species which can aid analysis. Functional groups include diatoms dinoflagellates flagellates ciliates (including tintinnids) silicoflagellates and cyanobacteria. Once downloaded and binned as required data are suitable for use in the creation of ecological indicators. For example: ? Total diatoms dinoflagellates ? Diatom:Dinoflagellate ratio ? Total phytoplankton abundance or biomass per degree square. Abundance (cells.L-1) for the phytoplankton counts is given where it is available providing more information about the productivity of an area than presence data alone. A low cell abundance may indicate a low level or production but this may not be the case if these are large cells. The biomass data helps to show productivity of an area. The biovolume has been calculated for each cell count and when converted to biomass is available for use by modellers and to assist in interpretation of an area?s productivity. An accepted method of converting biovolume to biomass is to assume that the cell has the density of water (1 mm3 .L-1 = 1 mg.L- 1 ) 13. Another useful conversion is to carbon biomass; full methods are readily found in the literature24-26. Table 2 gives details conversions of phytoplankton size data to carbon biomass. Some of the data records are missing dates or coordinates. It was considered useful to keep these records as the presence of a taxa in a location may still be of value. The user may estimate coordinates from the location given and would then also be aware that these would not be the exact coordinates of the sample. Data can be analysed in many different ways and in many software applications (e.g. R Matlab). The list of citations referenced in Table 1 will also give users information as to how this data has been previously used from the discrete projects.

Dataset methods
Two water samples are collected: a) a 500ml depth-integrated water sample representing the first 1 meter of the water column and, b) 200ml concentrated water samples by dragging a phytoplankton net (25 micron pore size) for 2 minutes. Both samples were immediately preserved with Lugol's iodine solution for later identification and enumeration of phytoplankton. Cell enumeration and detailed examination of cells were carried out using Zeiss Axiolab or Standard microscopes equipped with phase contrast. Cells were identified to the closest taxon that could be accurately identified using light microscopy (maximum magnification × 1000). In the laboratory, samples were concentrated by gravity-assisted membrane filtration, and phytoplankton cell counts were undertaken in a Sedgewick Rafter counting chamber.

Dataset methods
Sample collection via 20um vertical plankton drop to 10m preserved with Lugols and identified with light microscopy
Database methods
Sampling was done via research vessels container ships and small boats by experienced researchers students and volunteers. The majority of the samples were preserved using Lugol?s solution although formalin paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde have also been used. Different methods of preservation can affect the condition of the sample and which taxa are well preserved 417. Samples were analysed with standard methods including light microscopy transmission or scanning electron microscopy which are described in Hallegraeff et al. All methodological variations within our phytoplankton database are detailed in the metadata where available and recorded for each data entry. 
Where available a citation is referenced for each project which gives details on methodologies and limitations from that project (Table 1). There were three stages in data gathering. The first stage was to conduct a literature review of Australian phytoplankton data. Any literature that contained abundance or presence data was digitised and uploaded into the CSIRO maintained Oracle database. The second stage was to scan already existing databases such as the CSIRO data trawler the Ocean Biogeographic Ocean System (OBIS) and the Atlas of Living Australia (AOLA). These repositories only store presence records. Relevant data were selected and uploaded into the database. The third stage was to ask researchers to contribute any other data sets that they had. All data were organised into a standard format and uploaded into the database. Data were then served to and hosted by the AODN. 
Taxa methods
All taxa have been verified as accepted species and given the currently accepted name as defined by the World Register of Marine Species database (WoRMS -http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=webservice). If any taxa could not be verified then a second check was done through AlgaeBase (http://www.algaebase.org/). If this did not verify that taxa as a valid name then the taxonomic level of identification was decreased to a satisfactory level or the entry removed. All abundance values were standardised to cells.L-1 or are given as presence only. Records of the original identifications and units were archived so any records can be checked. Identification of the smaller phytoplankton is often to a coarser taxonomic level as many cannot be distinguished to species using light microscopy. In some studies electron microscopy has been used to determine species but in other studies functional groups have been identified. Cell biovolume is calculated as per Hillebrand et al. 19 following the suggested shape factors for each genera. Size parameters were estimated from measurements taken from Australian samples or Australian references where available420 and other sources where not21-23. In some data sets direct measurements of size classes (e.g. P599 the Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey and P597 the IMOS National Reference Stations) were used in preference to literature values. For some taxa there was insufficient information available to estimate a biovolume these were generally the rare taxa. Rather than estimate a size class without any information available these have been left blank. 
Data Records
Each data record represents the abundance or presence of a phytoplankton taxa at a certain point in space and time and has been given a unique record identification number P(project_id)_(sample_id)_(record_id). Each data record belongs to a project with each project having a unique identification number Pxxx. A project is defined as a set of data records which have been collected together usually as a cruise or study with the same sampling method and having the same person counting the samples. Metadata ascribed to a project relates to all the data records within that project. Details to identify each separate project are given in Table 1. Each sample within that project has a unique sample_id. The sample_id has not been changed from the original data set to maintain traceability. So these may be duplicated between projects but P(project_id)_(sample_id) will be a unique entity in space and time. Species abundance records within the sample are given a unique record_id.
Technical Validation
The Phytoplankton Database will provide an extensive resource for phytoplankton researchers although there are some caveats due to the variety of the sampling and analysis protocols. The various sample collection methods infer that abundances might not always be directlycomparable across projects. For example quantitative methods such as bottle sampling (e.g. Project 599) will collect all but the rarest phytoplankton and will include the whole size spectrum whereas semi-quantitative methods such as net sampling are selective and dependent on tow method mesh size and the mix of species present in the water as some species may clog the net and trap smaller species that would otherwise go through the mesh (e.g. Project 509)21. By including all data collected using different methods and including this information as meta-data researchers are able to analyse the relative abundance of each taxa within a project and compare across compatible projects. Metadata includes as much detail as is available about sampling methods and limitations and provides guidance to the users about the potential of each data set. Users should consider collection methods preservation techniques and microscopic limitations when comparing datasets. All datasets have been standardised to taxa/m3 of water except P1070 where the units are taxa per gram of substrate measured. This project collected the phytoplankton by collecting substrates and analysing parts of the substrate. It is included here as the only data set on Gambierdiscus and associated benthic dinoflagellates from Australia which are important to the studies of the ciguatera. All datasets submitted can be interpreted as confirming the presence of those species recorded. In some datasets e.g. time series it is possible also to infer absences assuming that all species are looked for on each sampling occasion. Absences have been included in the data sets where the project information available allowed us the confidence to interpret such absences correctly. The interpretation of absences from other projects is at the discretion of the user. We suggest that a project-by-project approach should be taken. If a taxa is notobserved at all in a project then the absence could be due to the taxa not being present that taxa not being of interest to the analyst or the inability to identify that taxa. Thus a real absence should not be inferred. If a taxa is observed in some samples of a project it can most likely be assumed that the microscopist could identify the taxa and that a real absence may be inferred in samples within that project where the taxa was not marked as present. Some data records were removed when there was ambiguity as to the identification of the taxa i.e. when the taxonomic traceability usually from older sources was confused or whenspelling mistakes make it unclear which one of two species was meant. Species known as freshwater species were removed as the methods used to collect data were not aimed at freshwater environments and the inclusion of the odd records of these species would not be comprehensive or meaningful. Estuarine species were captured and the records kept. Data records with positions on land with an unreal number for abundance or with impossible dates were also removed or converted to presence records.
Usage Notes
The database contains information on the functional group of the species which can aid analysis. Functional groups include diatoms dinoflagellates flagellates ciliates (including tintinnids) silicoflagellates and cyanobacteria. Once downloaded and binned as required data are suitable for use in the creation of ecological indicators. For example: ? Total diatoms dinoflagellates ? Diatom:Dinoflagellate ratio ? Total phytoplankton abundance or biomass per degree square. Abundance (cells.L-1) for the phytoplankton counts is given where it is available providing more information about the productivity of an area than presence data alone. A low cell abundance may indicate a low level or production but this may not be the case if these are large cells. The biomass data helps to show productivity of an area. The biovolume has been calculated for each cell count and when converted to biomass is available for use by modellers and to assist in interpretation of an area?s productivity. An accepted method of converting biovolume to biomass is to assume that the cell has the density of water (1 mm3 .L-1 = 1 mg.L- 1 ) 13. Another useful conversion is to carbon biomass; full methods are readily found in the literature24-26. Table 2 gives details conversions of phytoplankton size data to carbon biomass. Some of the data records are missing dates or coordinates. It was considered useful to keep these records as the presence of a taxa in a location may still be of value. The user may estimate coordinates from the location given and would then also be aware that these would not be the exact coordinates of the sample. Data can be analysed in many different ways and in many software applications (e.g. R Matlab).

Methanol extraction of samples preserved in Lugol's solution. (BioTIME curator found a similar paper with possible matching methods from the data custodian, but this is not confirmed. The following methods may provide more details from Leterme et al. 2014 in Oceanologia) At each site and depth, 1 L samples of seawater were taken and preserved with Lugols iodine added to each bottle (0.5%) final concentration, Hajdu et al. 2007) for identification and enumeration of phytoplankton species (>5 ?m). Identification and enumeration of phytoplankton was carried out every two weeks by Microalgal Supply Service (Ormond, Victoria, Australia). The cells were identified up to the genus or species level based on their key taxonomic features (Tomas 1997, Hallegraef et al. 2010) and grouped according to their size and shape.

Methods from a potential paper referring to the same dataset (Ajani et al. 2020, Frontiers in Marine Science): Monthly sampling with a 20 micron mesh net, 0-50 m. 
The Port Hacking 100 m station (hereafter PH100m), one of the Pacific Oceans longest time series stations, is 5 km from Sydney on the east coast of Australia (Figure 1). As part of the National Reference Station Network in Australias Integrated Marine Observing System (Lynch et al., 2014; Eriksen et al., 2019), PH100m is in a highly complex and energetic oceanographic region of the Tasman Sea.
Database methods
Sampling was done via research vessels container ships and small boats by experienced researchers students and volunteers. The majority of the samples were preserved using Lugol?s solution although formalin paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde have also been used. Different methods of preservation can affect the condition of the sample and which taxa are well preserved 417. Samples were analysed with standard methods including light microscopy transmission or scanning electron microscopy which are described in Hallegraeff et al. All methodological variations within our phytoplankton database are detailed in the metadata where available and recorded for each data entry. 
Where available a citation is referenced for each project which gives details on methodologies and limitations from that project (Table 1). There were three stages in data gathering. The first stage was to conduct a literature review of Australian phytoplankton data. Any literature that contained abundance or presence data was digitised and uploaded into the CSIRO maintained Oracle database. The second stage was to scan already existing databases such as the CSIRO data trawler the Ocean Biogeographic Ocean System (OBIS) and the Atlas of Living Australia (AOLA). These repositories only store presence records. Relevant data were selected and uploaded into the database. The third stage was to ask researchers to contribute any other data sets that they had. All data were organised into a standard format and uploaded into the database. Data were then served to and hosted by the AODN. 
Taxa methods
All taxa have been verified as accepted species and given the currently accepted name as defined by the World Register of Marine Species database (WoRMS -http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=webservice). If any taxa could not be verified then a second check was done through AlgaeBase (http://www.algaebase.org/). If this did not verify that taxa as a valid name then the taxonomic level of identification was decreased to a satisfactory level or the entry removed. All abundance values were standardised to cells.L-1 or are given as presence only. Records of the original identifications and units were archived so any records can be checked. Identification of the smaller phytoplankton is often to a coarser taxonomic level as many cannot be distinguished to species using light microscopy. In some studies electron microscopy has been used to determine species but in other studies functional groups have been identified. Cell biovolume is calculated as per Hillebrand et al. 19 following the suggested shape factors for each genera. Size parameters were estimated from measurements taken from Australian samples or Australian references where available420 and other sources where not21-23. In some data sets direct measurements of size classes (e.g. P599 the Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey and P597 the IMOS National Reference Stations) were used in preference to literature values. For some taxa there was insufficient information available to estimate a biovolume these were generally the rare taxa. Rather than estimate a size class without any information available these have been left blank. 
Data Records
Each data record represents the abundance or presence of a phytoplankton taxa at a certain point in space and time and has been given a unique record identification number P(project_id)_(sample_id)_(record_id). Each data record belongs to a project with each project having a unique identification number Pxxx. A project is defined as a set of data records which have been collected together usually as a cruise or study with the same sampling method and having the same person counting the samples. Metadata ascribed to a project relates to all the data records within that project. Details to identify each separate project are given in Table 1. Each sample within that project has a unique sample_id. The sample_id has not been changed from the original data set to maintain traceability. So these may be duplicated between projects but P(project_id)_(sample_id) will be a unique entity in space and time. Species abundance records within the sample are given a unique record_id.
Technical Validation
The Phytoplankton Database will provide an extensive resource for phytoplankton researchers although there are some caveats due to the variety of the sampling and analysis protocols. The various sample collection methods infer that abundances might not always be directlycomparable across projects. For example quantitative methods such as bottle sampling (e.g. Project 599) will collect all but the rarest phytoplankton and will include the whole size spectrum whereas semi-quantitative methods such as net sampling are selective and dependent on tow method mesh size and the mix of species present in the water as some species may clog the net and trap smaller species that would otherwise go through the mesh (e.g. Project 509)21. By including all data collected using different methods and including this information as meta-data researchers are able to analyse the relative abundance of each taxa within a project and compare across compatible projects. Metadata includes as much detail as is available about sampling methods and limitations and provides guidance to the users about the potential of each data set. Users should consider collection methods preservation techniques and microscopic limitations when comparing datasets. All datasets have been standardised to taxa/m3 of water except P1070 where the units are taxa per gram of substrate measured. This project collected the phytoplankton by collecting substrates and analysing parts of the substrate. It is included here as the only data set on Gambierdiscus and associated benthic dinoflagellates from Australia which are important to the studies of the ciguatera. All datasets submitted can be interpreted as confirming the presence of those species recorded. In some datasets e.g. time series it is possible also to infer absences assuming that all species are looked for on each sampling occasion. Absences have been included in the data sets where the project information available allowed us the confidence to interpret such absences correctly. The interpretation of absences from other projects is at the discretion of the user. We suggest that a project-by-project approach should be taken. If a taxa is notobserved at all in a project then the absence could be due to the taxa not being present that taxa not being of interest to the analyst or the inability to identify that taxa. Thus a real absence should not be inferred. If a taxa is observed in some samples of a project it can most likely be assumed that the microscopist could identify the taxa and that a real absence may be inferred in samples within that project where the taxa was not marked as present. Some data records were removed when there was ambiguity as to the identification of the taxa i.e. when the taxonomic traceability usually from older sources was confused or whenspelling mistakes make it unclear which one of two species was meant. Species known as freshwater species were removed as the methods used to collect data were not aimed at freshwater environments and the inclusion of the odd records of these species would not be comprehensive or meaningful. Estuarine species were captured and the records kept. Data records with positions on land with an unreal number for abundance or with impossible dates were also removed or converted to presence records.
Usage Notes
The database contains information on the functional group of the species which can aid analysis. Functional groups include diatoms dinoflagellates flagellates ciliates (including tintinnids) silicoflagellates and cyanobacteria. Once downloaded and binned as required data are suitable for use in the creation of ecological indicators. For example: ? Total diatoms dinoflagellates ? Diatom:Dinoflagellate ratio ? Total phytoplankton abundance or biomass per degree square. Abundance (cells.L-1) for the phytoplankton counts is given where it is available providing more information about the productivity of an area than presence data alone. A low cell abundance may indicate a low level or production but this may not be the case if these are large cells. The biomass data helps to show productivity of an area. The biovolume has been calculated for each cell count and when converted to biomass is available for use by modellers and to assist in interpretation of an area?s productivity. An accepted method of converting biovolume to biomass is to assume that the cell has the density of water (1 mm3 .L-1 = 1 mg.L- 1 ) 13. Another useful conversion is to carbon biomass; full methods are readily found in the literature24-26. Table 2 gives details conversions of phytoplankton size data to carbon biomass. Some of the data records are missing dates or coordinates. It was considered useful to keep these records as the presence of a taxa in a location may still be of value. The user may estimate coordinates from the location given and would then also be aware that these would not be the exact coordinates of the sample. Data can be analysed in many different ways and in many software applications (e.g. R Matlab). The list of citations referenced in Table 1 will also give users information as to how this data has been previously used from the discrete projects. ",Database provided methods: acetone extraction.

More detailed methods located by BioTIME curator that may apply to this dataset from the author's other published works. (The B line referred here is likely to refer to the data)The sampling design for this phytoplankton survey built on the established IMOS infrastructure at Coffs Harbour and stations were chosen to include the moorings CH070 and CH100 (Figs. 1, 2; section 1.5). Sampling was undertaken along a Northern and a Southern transect (hereafter B-line and CH-Line, respectively) about 30 km apart. An intermediate coastal station (SS) was included to create an alongshore-transect (Figs. 1, 2). The terminology used here is consistent with previous oceanographic work that has been conducted in the Coffs Harbour region within the IMOS context. The CH-Line and the B-Line extended 26 and 28 km off the coast, respectively. Phytoplankton sampling stations, numbered in ascending order (B2 and CH1, B4 and CH2, B6 and CH3, B8 and CH5) were located at the 25, 50, 70 and 100 m isobaths across the continental shelf (Figs. 1, 2). Both the CH and the B-line extend from the coastal SIMP into the adjacent Solitary Islands Marine Reserve (east of the 50 m isobath). Sampling was done monthly. The 2 L samples collected on board RV Bombora and RV Circe were transported to the laboratories of the Sydney Institute of Marine Sciences (SIMS, Chowder Bay, NSW) and concentrated by sedimentation. During the sedimentation procedure, the 2 L samples were settled for 48 hrs and siphoned twice, to achieve a final concentrated sample volume of 100 mL. Depending on the cell density, a 3 mL subsample of the 100 mL sample was counted, or the 100 mL sample was further concentrated within an Utermöhl sediment cylinder mounted onto a 3 mL counting chamber (HydroBios, Germany). Identification and enumeration under an inverted microscope (Leica DMI 3000B) followed the protocols of Utermöhl (1958). At least 400 cells per sample were counted at 200x.

Dataset methods
Sample collection via Van Dorn sampler, identified with light microscopy.
Database methods
Sampling was done via research vessels container ships and small boats by experienced researchers students and volunteers. The majority of the samples were preserved using Lugol?s solution although formalin paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde have also been used. Different methods of preservation can affect the condition of the sample and which taxa are well preserved 417. Samples were analysed with standard methods including light microscopy transmission or scanning electron microscopy which are described in Hallegraeff et al. All methodological variations within our phytoplankton database are detailed in the metadata where available and recorded for each data entry. 
Where available a citation is referenced for each project which gives details on methodologies and limitations from that project (Table 1). There were three stages in data gathering. The first stage was to conduct a literature review of Australian phytoplankton data. Any literature that contained abundance or presence data was digitised and uploaded into the CSIRO maintained Oracle database. The second stage was to scan already existing databases such as the CSIRO data trawler the Ocean Biogeographic Ocean System (OBIS) and the Atlas of Living Australia (AOLA). These repositories only store presence records. Relevant data were selected and uploaded into the database. The third stage was to ask researchers to contribute any other data sets that they had. All data were organised into a standard format and uploaded into the database. Data were then served to and hosted by the AODN. 
Taxa methods
All taxa have been verified as accepted species and given the currently accepted name as defined by the World Register of Marine Species database (WoRMS -http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=webservice). If any taxa could not be verified then a second check was done through AlgaeBase (http://www.algaebase.org/). If this did not verify that taxa as a valid name then the taxonomic level of identification was decreased to a satisfactory level or the entry removed. All abundance values were standardised to cells.L-1 or are given as presence only. Records of the original identifications and units were archived so any records can be checked. Identification of the smaller phytoplankton is often to a coarser taxonomic level as many cannot be distinguished to species using light microscopy. In some studies electron microscopy has been used to determine species but in other studies functional groups have been identified. Cell biovolume is calculated as per Hillebrand et al. 19 following the suggested shape factors for each genera. Size parameters were estimated from measurements taken from Australian samples or Australian references where available420 and other sources where not21-23. In some data sets direct measurements of size classes (e.g. P599 the Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey and P597 the IMOS National Reference Stations) were used in preference to literature values. For some taxa there was insufficient information available to estimate a biovolume these were generally the rare taxa. Rather than estimate a size class without any information available these have been left blank. 
Data Records
Each data record represents the abundance or presence of a phytoplankton taxa at a certain point in space and time and has been given a unique record identification number P(project_id)_(sample_id)_(record_id). Each data record belongs to a project with each project having a unique identification number Pxxx. A project is defined as a set of data records which have been collected together usually as a cruise or study with the same sampling method and having the same person counting the samples. Metadata ascribed to a project relates to all the data records within that project. Details to identify each separate project are given in Table 1. Each sample within that project has a unique sample_id. The sample_id has not been changed from the original data set to maintain traceability. So these may be duplicated between projects but P(project_id)_(sample_id) will be a unique entity in space and time. Species abundance records within the sample are given a unique record_id.
Technical Validation
The Phytoplankton Database will provide an extensive resource for phytoplankton researchers although there are some caveats due to the variety of the sampling and analysis protocols. The various sample collection methods infer that abundances might not always be directlycomparable across projects. For example quantitative methods such as bottle sampling (e.g. Project 599) will collect all but the rarest phytoplankton and will include the whole size spectrum whereas semi-quantitative methods such as net sampling are selective and dependent on tow method mesh size and the mix of species present in the water as some species may clog the net and trap smaller species that would otherwise go through the mesh (e.g. Project 509)21. By including all data collected using different methods and including this information as meta-data researchers are able to analyse the relative abundance of each taxa within a project and compare across compatible projects. Metadata includes as much detail as is available about sampling methods and limitations and provides guidance to the users about the potential of each data set. Users should consider collection methods preservation techniques and microscopic limitations when comparing datasets. All datasets have been standardised to taxa/m3 of water except P1070 where the units are taxa per gram of substrate measured. This project collected the phytoplankton by collecting substrates and analysing parts of the substrate. It is included here as the only data set on Gambierdiscus and associated benthic dinoflagellates from Australia which are important to the studies of the ciguatera. All datasets submitted can be interpreted as confirming the presence of those species recorded. In some datasets e.g. time series it is possible also to infer absences assuming that all species are looked for on each sampling occasion. Absences have been included in the data sets where the project information available allowed us the confidence to interpret such absences correctly. The interpretation of absences from other projects is at the discretion of the user. We suggest that a project-by-project approach should be taken. If a taxa is notobserved at all in a project then the absence could be due to the taxa not being present that taxa not being of interest to the analyst or the inability to identify that taxa. Thus a real absence should not be inferred. If a taxa is observed in some samples of a project it can most likely be assumed that the microscopist could identify the taxa and that a real absence may be inferred in samples within that project where the taxa was not marked as present. Some data records were removed when there was ambiguity as to the identification of the taxa i.e. when the taxonomic traceability usually from older sources was confused or whenspelling mistakes make it unclear which one of two species was meant. Species known as freshwater species were removed as the methods used to collect data were not aimed at freshwater environments and the inclusion of the odd records of these species would not be comprehensive or meaningful. Estuarine species were captured and the records kept. Data records with positions on land with an unreal number for abundance or with impossible dates were also removed or converted to presence records.
Usage Notes
The database contains information on the functional group of the species which can aid analysis. Functional groups include diatoms dinoflagellates flagellates ciliates (including tintinnids) silicoflagellates and cyanobacteria. Once downloaded and binned as required data are suitable for use in the creation of ecological indicators. For example: ? Total diatoms dinoflagellates ? Diatom:Dinoflagellate ratio ? Total phytoplankton abundance or biomass per degree square. Abundance (cells.L-1) for the phytoplankton counts is given where it is available providing more information about the productivity of an area than presence data alone. A low cell abundance may indicate a low level or production but this may not be the case if these are large cells. The biomass data helps to show productivity of an area. The biovolume has been calculated for each cell count and when converted to biomass is available for use by modellers and to assist in interpretation of an area?s productivity. An accepted method of converting biovolume to biomass is to assume that the cell has the density of water (1 mm3 .L-1 = 1 mg.L- 1 ) 13. Another useful conversion is to carbon biomass; full methods are readily found in the literature24-26. Table 2 gives details conversions of phytoplankton size data to carbon biomass. Some of the data records are missing dates or coordinates. It was considered useful to keep these records as the presence of a taxa in a location may still be of value. The user may estimate coordinates from the location given and would then also be aware that these would not be the exact coordinates of the sample. Data can be analysed in many different ways and in many software applications (e.g. R Matlab).

Dataset methods
BioTIME curator: No methods accompany this dataset from the database, but here are detailed methods from a potential related paper by Eriksen et al. 2018 in MEPS doi.org/10.3354/meps12420 
The SOTS Pulse mooring lies to the south of the Subtropical Front (STF), approximately 530 km southwest of Tasmania at 46° 56 S, 142° 15' E. A Remote Access Sampler (RAS-500 McLane Labs) filled forty-eight 500 ml Tedlar bags in pairs (collected 1 h apart at 02:00 and 03:00 UTC) at pre-programmed 9-d intervals, between 12 September 2010 and 7 April 2011. The RAS uses a common inlet and distributes samples to the bags via a multi-port valve without passing through a pump, thus avoiding mechanical damage of cells and potential contamination from pump components. The smallest cross-sectional area of the sampling flow path is 1.51 mm2 (diameter 1.39 mm) and thus should effectively sample all phytoplankton species, including colonial and chain-forming morphologies. Prior to deployment, the RAS was primed with approximately 5 ml of distilled, deionized water, filling all spaces to prevent air-locks. One bag in each pair was pre-loaded with saturated aqueous mercuric chloride (Alfa Aesar Puratronic, 99.999%, to achieve a final concentration of 80 ?M in the collected sample) for measurement of dissolved constituents (without filtration), including inorganic carbon, alkalinity and nutrients. The other bag in each pair was pre-loaded with microscopy-grade, low-acidity glutaraldehyde (Merck, final concentration 1%). Upon retrieval, samples were refrigerated at 4°C in the dark until analysis. Due to the biomass, samples were pre-concentrated by sedimentation. Sample bags were gently mixed, and the entire sample volume was decanted into 500 ml tall-form measuring cylinders, and Lugols iodine was added to aid sedimentation (Sournia 1978). The settled samples were drawn down to 100 ml after 1 wk, decanted into tall form 100 ml cylinders and concentrated to a final volume of 15 ml after a further 1 wk of settling. Pre-concentrated samples were stored in amber glass vials at 4°C until examination. Counts were performed on a 6 ml aliquot transferred to a Utermöhl chamber, using an Olympus IX81 inverted microscope (differential interference contrast or phase contrast) at 320×. The highest magnification for identification was 630×.

I removed any size or life stage information from these working taxa names but kept morphological terms that may be taxonomically relevant to distinguish between uncertain species (e.g. centric vs pennate diatoms). Any records that note fragments or parts were also filtered out.Script: study354_recurate_Australia_phytoplankton.R. Note AFE: For observations with missing depths, the second element of SAMPLE_DESC is also missing. AFE: As part of the standardisation of the DepthElevation column, depth values, when available, were multiplied by (-1). In SampleID, any underscores were replaced with dashes, as underscores are reserved to separate SAMPLE_DESC elements in BioTIME. Users can revert to using underscores to match the sample IDs in the Australian Phytoplankton database.",N,CC,N,24-Mar,Density,Volume,sampleID_depth

The Australian Zooplankton Database Metadata:
[extracted from https://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E095/278/metadata.php]
-Experimental or sampling design: Data have been collected using different equipment and sampling designs. Zooplankton have been generally collected by net, although Project 597 has used a Continuous Plankton Recorder. Nets used have varying mesh sizes and we have included these where available. Data have been sourced from research cruises, student projects, published literature and time series surveys. Details of each project are described in the file zooplankton_metadata.csv. These metadata should allow users to understand how the data compare with those from other projects when analyzing across data sets.
The taxonomic resolution for each project varies according to the aims of each specific survey. This can be especially important when using the data to interpret absences. Absences can be (a) true where the analyst did not find the target taxa, or (b) not truly representative; when the taxa were not sampled for or identified at low resolution (e.g., copepod naupliar lifestages), or the analyst did not look for the particular taxa and presence or absence was not determined. The resolution to which each data set was counted is detailed in the file zooplankton_metadata.csv. We recommend that if a taxon is not mentioned within a project then a real absence should not be interpreted. If a taxon is mentioned in some samples and not others, from within the same data set, a real absence can be inferred.
-Taxonomy and systematics: All species names have been verified in the process of uploading the data. Each species name has been updated to the current accepted scientific name according to WoRMS (World Register of Marine Species). For taxa where species identifications cannot be confirmed, a higher taxonomic level has been applied. Much of the data set also includes information on gender for copepods because species identification usually necessitates determination of gender. Taxonomic sheets, which provide species identifications and distribution maps, have been published for many of the common species (mainly copepods) included here and can be found at the Australian Zooplankton Taxonomic Guide and Atlas website (Richardson et al. 2013, Swadling et al. 2013).
All data have been standardised to abundance (number per m3 of water filtered) and are therefore comparable across data sets (within the constraints of mesh size and sampling procedures). The sample depth and the water depth at the sample location have been included as fields in the data file so the user can to convert to abundance per m² using whichever depth is relevant to their requirements. This will increase the usability of the data set and improve comparability between shallow and deep tows and locations. The Australian Bathymetry and Topography, June 2009 (http://www.ga.gov.au/corporate_data/67703/Rec2009_021.pdf) and ETOPO2v2 2006 (http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/relief/ETOPO2/ETOPO2v2-2006/) were used to estimate the water depth for each sample location.
We have given the average total length of adult copepods, since copepods have determinate growth, and the body size data is easily available and accepted. The juvenile size is assumed as the smallest adult size in the range given for the adult of that species. The majority of the copepod length data has been compiled from Bradford-Grieve et al. (1999) and the marine planktonic copepod website (Razouls et al. 2005-2014). Other sources were Ruth Böttger-Schnack via personal communications for Oncaeaidae and Frost and Fleminger (1968) for Clausocalanus. Size coefficients are not given for other taxa, for which the sizes are not well known and can vary greatly depending on age (not recorded in the datasets) or environmental conditions.
Surveys pertaining only to ichthyoplankton have not been included in this data set. They potentially warrant a separate database due to the volume of data available and there is already a considerable amount of data synthesis in this field.
-Data verification: Anomalous data, with uncertain species identifications, locations on land, or data with missing values have been excluded from the data set.
Exact sampling dates were not known for some projects and had to be estimated for Projects 18, 24, 29, and 615 from information given in the associated literature. The sampling date range is given in the file zooplankton_metadata.csv. The temporal resolution of the sampling is detailed in the sample_year, sample_month, sample_day and sample_time_UTC fields of the file zooplankton_metadata.csv. Exact sampling locations were not known for some of the sampling sites in Project 615. These have been inferred from figures showing the ships track and sampling locations. These data will be adequate for use in long-term time series or mapping distribution, but care will be needed if associating these values with contemporaneous environmental variables.
-Data set usage history: Some of the included data have been used in the Australian Marine Zooplankton Taxonomic Guide and Atlas to map species distributions (Richardson et al. 2013, Swadling et al. 2013) and to provide initial comparisons of tropical copepod communities (McKinnon and Duggan 2014). Large-scale analysis of these data has not yet been undertaken, but it is hoped that the publication of this data set will facilitate further analysis.

The Australian Zooplankton Database Metadata:
[extracted from https://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E095/278/metadata.php]
-Experimental or sampling design: Data have been collected using different equipment and sampling designs. Zooplankton have been generally collected by net, although Project 597 has used a Continuous Plankton Recorder. Nets used have varying mesh sizes and we have included these where available. Data have been sourced from research cruises, student projects, published literature and time series surveys. Details of each project are described in the file zooplankton_metadata.csv. These metadata should allow users to understand how the data compare with those from other projects when analyzing across data sets.
The taxonomic resolution for each project varies according to the aims of each specific survey. This can be especially important when using the data to interpret absences. Absences can be (a) true where the analyst did not find the target taxa, or (b) not truly representative; when the taxa were not sampled for or identified at low resolution (e.g., copepod naupliar lifestages), or the analyst did not look for the particular taxa and presence or absence was not determined. The resolution to which each data set was counted is detailed in the file zooplankton_metadata.csv. We recommend that if a taxon is not mentioned within a project then a real absence should not be interpreted. If a taxon is mentioned in some samples and not others, from within the same data set, a real absence can be inferred.
-Taxonomy and systematics: All species names have been verified in the process of uploading the data. Each species name has been updated to the current accepted scientific name according to WoRMS (World Register of Marine Species). For taxa where species identifications cannot be confirmed, a higher taxonomic level has been applied. Much of the data set also includes information on gender for copepods because species identification usually necessitates determination of gender. Taxonomic sheets, which provide species identifications and distribution maps, have been published for many of the common species (mainly copepods) included here and can be found at the Australian Zooplankton Taxonomic Guide and Atlas website (Richardson et al. 2013, Swadling et al. 2013).
All data have been standardised to abundance (number per m3 of water filtered) and are therefore comparable across data sets (within the constraints of mesh size and sampling procedures). The sample depth and the water depth at the sample location have been included as fields in the data file so the user can to convert to abundance per m² using whichever depth is relevant to their requirements. This will increase the usability of the data set and improve comparability between shallow and deep tows and locations. The Australian Bathymetry and Topography, June 2009 (http://www.ga.gov.au/corporate_data/67703/Rec2009_021.pdf) and ETOPO2v2 2006 (http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/relief/ETOPO2/ETOPO2v2-2006/) were used to estimate the water depth for each sample location.
We have given the average total length of adult copepods, since copepods have determinate growth, and the body size data is easily available and accepted. The juvenile size is assumed as the smallest adult size in the range given for the adult of that species. The majority of the copepod length data has been compiled from Bradford-Grieve et al. (1999) and the marine planktonic copepod website (Razouls et al. 2005-2014). Other sources were Ruth Böttger-Schnack via personal communications for Oncaeaidae and Frost and Fleminger (1968) for Clausocalanus. Size coefficients are not given for other taxa, for which the sizes are not well known and can vary greatly depending on age (not recorded in the datasets) or environmental conditions.
Surveys pertaining only to ichthyoplankton have not been included in this data set. They potentially warrant a separate database due to the volume of data available and there is already a considerable amount of data synthesis in this field.
-Data verification: Anomalous data, with uncertain species identifications, locations on land, or data with missing values have been excluded from the data set.
Exact sampling dates were not known for some projects and had to be estimated for Projects 18, 24, 29, and 615 from information given in the associated literature. The sampling date range is given in the file zooplankton_metadata.csv. The temporal resolution of the sampling is detailed in the sample_year, sample_month, sample_day and sample_time_UTC fields of the file zooplankton_metadata.csv. Exact sampling locations were not known for some of the sampling sites in Project 615. These have been inferred from figures showing the ships track and sampling locations. These data will be adequate for use in long-term time series or mapping distribution, but care will be needed if associating these values with contemporaneous environmental variables.
-Data set usage history: Some of the included data have been used in the Australian Marine Zooplankton Taxonomic Guide and Atlas to map species distributions (Richardson et al. 2013, Swadling et al. 2013) and to provide initial comparisons of tropical copepod communities (McKinnon and Duggan 2014). Large-scale analysis of these data has not yet been undertaken, but it is hoped that the publication of this data set will facilitate further analysis. Most of the projects have been analysed for the purpose for which they were collected and published. Details of these publications and the projects can be found in the file zooplankton_metadata.csv.

We recommend that if a taxon is not mentioned within a project then a real absence should not be interpreted. If a taxon is mentioned in some samples and not others, from within the same data set, a real absence can be inferred.
-Taxonomy and systematics: All species names have been verified in the process of uploading the data. Each species name has been updated to the current accepted scientific name according to WoRMS (World Register of Marine Species). For taxa where species identifications cannot be confirmed, a higher taxonomic level has been applied. Much of the data set also includes information on gender for copepods because species identification usually necessitates determination of gender. Taxonomic sheets, which provide species identifications and distribution maps, have been published for many of the common species (mainly copepods) included here and can be found at the Australian Zooplankton Taxonomic Guide and Atlas website (Richardson et al. 2013, Swadling et al. 2013).
All data have been standardised to abundance (number per m3 of water filtered) and are therefore comparable across data sets (within the constraints of mesh size and sampling procedures). The sample depth and the water depth at the sample location have been included as fields in the data file so the user can to convert to abundance per m² using whichever depth is relevant to their requirements. This will increase the usability of the data set and improve comparability between shallow and deep tows and locations. The Australian Bathymetry and Topography, June 2009 (http://www.ga.gov.au/corporate_data/67703/Rec2009_021.pdf) and ETOPO2v2 2006 (http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/relief/ETOPO2/ETOPO2v2-2006/) were used to estimate the water depth for each sample location.
We have given the average total length of adult copepods, since copepods have determinate growth, and the body size data is easily available and accepted. The juvenile size is assumed as the smallest adult size in the range given for the adult of that species. The majority of the copepod length data has been compiled from Bradford-Grieve et al. (1999) and the marine planktonic copepod website (Razouls et al. 2005-2014). Other sources were Ruth Böttger-Schnack via personal communications for Oncaeaidae and Frost and Fleminger (1968) for Clausocalanus. Size coefficients are not given for other taxa, for which the sizes are not well known and can vary greatly depending on age (not recorded in the datasets) or environmental conditions.
Surveys pertaining only to ichthyoplankton have not been included in this data set. They potentially warrant a separate database due to the volume of data available and there is already a considerable amount of data synthesis in this field.
-Data verification: Anomalous data, with uncertain species identifications, locations on land, or data with missing values have been excluded from the data set.
Exact sampling dates were not known for some projects and had to be estimated for Projects 18, 24, 29, and 615 from information given in the associated literature. The sampling date range is given in the file zooplankton_metadata.csv. The temporal resolution of the sampling is detailed in the sample_year, sample_month, sample_day and sample_time_UTC fields of the file zooplankton_metadata.csv. Exact sampling locations were not known for some of the sampling sites in Project 615. These have been inferred from figures showing the ships track and sampling locations. These data will be adequate for use in long-term time series or mapping distribution, but care will be needed if associating these values with contemporaneous environmental variables.
-Data set usage history: Some of the included data have been used in the Australian Marine Zooplankton Taxonomic Guide and Atlas to map species distributions (Richardson et al. 2013, Swadling et al. 2013) and to provide initial comparisons of tropical copepod communities (McKinnon and Duggan 2014).

This dataset is a subset from the The Australian Zooplankton Database collated by Claire Davies under Project ID 22.
Dataset Methods:
This dataset contains records for Project ID 22: Zooplankton sampling from Maria Island.	All copepods identified to species; other taxa identified to family or functional group. The methods used to collect the data are: double/rectangular nets of mesh size = 300microns &amp; samples are from vertical depths ranging between 0 &amp; 1 m.
General BioTIME curators note for The Australian Zooplankton Database: please be aware that spatial sampling effort might not be consistent throughout sampling events in some projects/time-series. This can be resolved with gridding and rarefaction, however we strongly recommend against using data for study-level analyses whenever spatial effort varies largely across samples.
The Australian Zooplankton Database Metadata:
[extracted from https://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E095/278/metadata.php]
-Experimental or sampling design: Data have been collected using different equipment and sampling designs. Zooplankton have been generally collected by net, although Project 597 has used a Continuous Plankton Recorder. Nets used have varying mesh sizes and we have included these where available. Data have been sourced from research cruises, student projects, published literature and time series surveys. Details of each project are described in the file zooplankton_metadata.csv. These metadata should allow users to understand how the data compare with those from other projects when analyzing across data sets.
The taxonomic resolution for each project varies according to the aims of each specific survey. This can be especially important when using the data to interpret absences. Absences can be (a) true where the analyst did not find the target taxa, or (b) not truly representative; when the taxa were not sampled for or identified at low resolution (e.g., copepod naupliar lifestages), or the analyst did not look for the particular taxa and presence or absence was not determined.

This dataset is a subset from the The Australian Zooplankton Database collated by Claire Davies under Project ID 4.
Dataset Methods:
This dataset contains records for Project ID 4: Zooplankton sampling in Darwin Harbour (Dec 2002 - Oct 2004). All copepods identified to species; other taxa identified to family or functional group. The methods used to collect the data are: net type = drop; net diameter = 0.5m, net mesh size = 73microns &amp; samples are from vertical depths ranging between 4 &amp; 30 m.
General BioTIME curators note for The Australian Zooplankton Database: please be aware that spatial sampling effort might not be consistent throughout sampling events in some projects/time-series. This can be resolved with gridding and rarefaction, however we strongly recommend against using data for study-level analyses whenever spatial effort varies largely across samples.
The Australian Zooplankton Database Metadata:
[extracted from https://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E095/278/metadata.php]
-Experimental or sampling design: Data have been collected using different equipment and sampling designs. Zooplankton have been generally collected by net, although Project 597 has used a Continuous Plankton Recorder. Nets used have varying mesh sizes and we have included these where available. Data have been sourced from research cruises, student projects, published literature and time series surveys. Details of each project are described in the file zooplankton_metadata.csv. These metadata should allow users to understand how the data compare with those from other projects when analyzing across data sets.
The taxonomic resolution for each project varies according to the aims of each specific survey. This can be especially important when using the data to interpret absences. Absences can be (a) true where the analyst did not find the target taxa, or (b) not truly representative; when the taxa were not sampled for or identified at low resolution (e.g., copepod naupliar lifestages), or the analyst did not look for the particular taxa and presence or absence was not determined. The resolution to which each data set was counted is detailed in the file zooplankton_metadata.csv. We recommend that if a taxon is not mentioned within a project then a real absence should not be interpreted. If a taxon is mentioned in some samples and not others, from within the same data set, a real absence can be inferred.
-Taxonomy and systematics: All species names have been verified in the process of uploading the data. Each species name has been updated to the current accepted scientific name according to WoRMS (World Register of Marine Species). For taxa where species identifications cannot be confirmed, a higher taxonomic level has been applied. Much of the data set also includes information on gender for copepods because species identification usually necessitates determination of gender. Taxonomic sheets, which provide species identifications and distribution maps, have been published for many of the common species (mainly copepods) included here and can be found at the Australian Zooplankton Taxonomic Guide and Atlas website (Richardson et al. 2013, Swadling et al. 2013).
All data have been standardised to abundance (number per m3 of water filtered) and are therefore comparable across data sets (within the constraints of mesh size and sampling procedures). The sample depth and the water depth at the sample location have been included as fields in the data file so the user can to convert to abundance per m² using whichever depth is relevant to their requirements. This will increase the usability of the data set and improve comparability between shallow and deep tows and locations. The Australian Bathymetry and Topography, June 2009 (http://www.ga.gov.au/corporate_data/67703/Rec2009_021.pdf) and ETOPO2v2 2006 (http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/relief/ETOPO2/ETOPO2v2-2006/) were used to estimate the water depth for each sample location.
We have given the average total length of adult copepods, since copepods have determinate growth, and the body size data is easily available and accepted. The juvenile size is assumed as the smallest adult size in the range given for the adult of that species. The majority of the copepod length data has been compiled from Bradford-Grieve et al. (1999) and the marine planktonic copepod website (Razouls et al. 2005-2014). Other sources were Ruth Böttger-Schnack via personal communications for Oncaeaidae and Frost and Fleminger (1968) for Clausocalanus. Size coefficients are not given for other taxa, for which the sizes are not well known and can vary greatly depending on age (not recorded in the datasets) or environmental conditions.
Surveys pertaining only to ichthyoplankton have not been included in this data set. They potentially warrant a separate database due to the volume of data available and there is already a considerable amount of data synthesis in this field.
-Data verification: Anomalous data, with uncertain species identifications, locations on land, or data with missing values have been excluded from the data set.
Exact sampling dates were not known for some projects and had to be estimated for Projects 18, 24, 29, and 615 from information given in the associated literature. The sampling date range is given in the file zooplankton_metadata.csv. The temporal resolution of the sampling is detailed in the sample_year, sample_month, sample_day and sample_time_UTC fields of the file zooplankton_metadata.csv. Exact sampling locations were not known for some of the sampling sites in Project 615. These have been inferred from figures showing the ships track and sampling locations. These data will be adequate for use in long-term time series or mapping distribution, but care will be needed if associating these values with contemporaneous environmental variables.
-Data set usage history: Some of the included data have been used in the Australian Marine Zooplankton Taxonomic Guide and Atlas to map species distributions (Richardson et al. 2013, Swadling et al. 2013) and to provide initial comparisons of tropical copepod communities (McKinnon and Duggan 2014). Large-scale analysis of these data has not yet been undertaken, but it is hoped that the publication of this data set will facilitate further analysis. Most of the projects have been analysed for the purpose for which they were collected and published. Details of these publications and the projects can be found in the file zooplankton_metadata.csv.",Drop nets of diameter 0.5m and mesh size 73microns,330,"Formerly study ID 330 (see curation notes 8 & 9).

-Data verification: Anomalous data, with uncertain species identifications, locations on land, or data with missing values have been excluded from the data set.
Exact sampling dates were not known for some projects and had to be estimated for Projects 18, 24, 29, and 615 from information given in the associated literature.

The temporal resolution of the sampling is detailed in the sample_year, sample_month, sample_day and sample_time_UTC fields of the file zooplankton_metadata.csv. Exact sampling locations were not known for some of the sampling sites in Project 615. These have been inferred from figures showing the ships track and sampling locations. These data will be adequate for use in long-term time series or mapping distribution, but care will be needed if associating these values with contemporaneous environmental variables.
-Data set usage history: Some of the included data have been used in the Australian Marine Zooplankton Taxonomic Guide and Atlas to map species distributions (Richardson et al. 2013, Swadling et al. 2013) and to provide initial comparisons of tropical copepod communities (McKinnon and Duggan 2014).

This dataset is a subset from the The Australian Zooplankton Database collated by Claire Davies under Project ID 597.
Dataset Methods:
This dataset contains records for Project ID 597: The IMOS Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey. All copepods identified to species, other taxa identified to highest resolution possible. Data were monitored with a continuous plankton recorder in vertical depths ranging between 2 &amp; 10 m. Continuous plankton recorder with a square aperture measuring 1.27 cm each side. The torpedo-shaped device is towed behind a ship at about 10 metres depth. Seawater and plankton enter the device through a small opening in the nose. This opening expands into a wider tunnel where the plantkon are trapped between two layers of silk and then preserved. In the laboratory, the silk layers are unrolled, cut into sections and plankton are then identified under the microscope. Formalin preserved samples identified in light microscopy.
General BioTIME curators note for The Australian Zooplankton Database: please be aware that spatial sampling effort might not be consistent throughout sampling events in some projects/time-series. This can be resolved with gridding and rarefaction, however we strongly recommend against using data for study-level analyses whenever spatial effort varies largely across samples.
The Australian Zooplankton Database Metadata:
[extracted from https://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E095/278/metadata.php]
-Experimental or sampling design: Data have been collected using different equipment and sampling designs. Zooplankton have been generally collected by net, although Project 597 has used a Continuous Plankton Recorder. Nets used have varying mesh sizes and we have included these where available. Data have been sourced from research cruises, student projects, published literature and time series surveys. Details of each project are described in the file zooplankton_metadata.csv. These metadata should allow users to understand how the data compare with those from other projects when analyzing across data sets.
The taxonomic resolution for each project varies according to the aims of each specific survey. This can be especially important when using the data to interpret absences. Absences can be (a) true where the analyst did not find the target taxa, or (b) not truly representative; when the taxa were not sampled for or identified at low resolution (e.g., copepod naupliar lifestages), or the analyst did not look for the particular taxa and presence or absence was not determined. The resolution to which each data set was counted is detailed in the file zooplankton_metadata.csv. We recommend that if a taxon is not mentioned within a project then a real absence should not be interpreted. If a taxon is mentioned in some samples and not others, from within the same data set, a real absence can be inferred.
-Taxonomy and systematics: All species names have been verified in the process of uploading the data. Each species name has been updated to the current accepted scientific name according to WoRMS (World Register of Marine Species). For taxa where species identifications cannot be confirmed, a higher taxonomic level has been applied. Much of the data set also includes information on gender for copepods because species identification usually necessitates determination of gender. Taxonomic sheets, which provide species identifications and distribution maps, have been published for many of the common species (mainly copepods) included here and can be found at the Australian Zooplankton Taxonomic Guide and Atlas website (Richardson et al. 2013, Swadling et al. 2013).
All data have been standardised to abundance (number per m3 of water filtered) and are therefore comparable across data sets (within the constraints of mesh size and sampling procedures). The sample depth and the water depth at the sample location have been included as fields in the data file so the user can to convert to abundance per m² using whichever depth is relevant to their requirements. This will increase the usability of the data set and improve comparability between shallow and deep tows and locations. The Australian Bathymetry and Topography, June 2009 (http://www.ga.gov.au/corporate_data/67703/Rec2009_021.pdf) and ETOPO2v2 2006 (http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/relief/ETOPO2/ETOPO2v2-2006/) were used to estimate the water depth for each sample location.
We have given the average total length of adult copepods, since copepods have determinate growth, and the body size data is easily available and accepted. The juvenile size is assumed as the smallest adult size in the range given for the adult of that species. The majority of the copepod length data has been compiled from Bradford-Grieve et al. (1999) and the marine planktonic copepod website (Razouls et al. 2005-2014). Other sources were Ruth Böttger-Schnack via personal communications for Oncaeaidae and Frost and Fleminger (1968) for Clausocalanus. Size coefficients are not given for other taxa, for which the sizes are not well known and can vary greatly depending on age (not recorded in the datasets) or environmental conditions.
Surveys pertaining only to ichthyoplankton have not been included in this data set. They potentially warrant a separate database due to the volume of data available and there is already a considerable amount of data synthesis in this field.

This dataset is a subset from the The Australian Zooplankton Database collated by Claire Davies under Project ID 599.
Dataset Methods:
This dataset contains records for Project ID 611:	1742 planktonic samples obtained from research vessel Warreen along the continental shelf and slope of southeast Australia from 193842. Selected taxa identified to functional group (Chaetognath; Appendicularian; Euphausiid). The methods used to collect the data are: net type = N70; net diameter = 0.7m, net mesh size = 430microns &amp; samples are from vertical depths ranging between 0 &amp; 50 m.
General BioTIME curators note for The Australian Zooplankton Database: please be aware that spatial sampling effort might not be consistent throughout sampling events in some projects/time-series. This can be resolved with gridding and rarefaction, however we strongly recommend against using data for study-level analyses whenever spatial effort varies largely across samples.
The Australian Zooplankton Database Metadata:
[extracted from https://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E095/278/metadata.php]
-Experimental or sampling design: Data have been collected using different equipment and sampling designs. Zooplankton have been generally collected by net, although Project 597 has used a Continuous Plankton Recorder. Nets used have varying mesh sizes and we have included these where available. Data have been sourced from research cruises, student projects, published literature and time series surveys. Details of each project are described in the file zooplankton_metadata.csv. These metadata should allow users to understand how the data compare with those from other projects when analyzing across data sets.
The taxonomic resolution for each project varies according to the aims of each specific survey. This can be especially important when using the data to interpret absences. Absences can be (a) true where the analyst did not find the target taxa, or (b) not truly representative; when the taxa were not sampled for or identified at low resolution (e.g., copepod naupliar lifestages), or the analyst did not look for the particular taxa and presence or absence was not determined. The resolution to which each data set was counted is detailed in the file zooplankton_metadata.csv. We recommend that if a taxon is not mentioned within a project then a real absence should not be interpreted. If a taxon is mentioned in some samples and not others, from within the same data set, a real absence can be inferred.
-Taxonomy and systematics: All species names have been verified in the process of uploading the data. Each species name has been updated to the current accepted scientific name according to WoRMS (World Register of Marine Species). For taxa where species identifications cannot be confirmed, a higher taxonomic level has been applied. Much of the data set also includes information on gender for copepods because species identification usually necessitates determination of gender. Taxonomic sheets, which provide species identifications and distribution maps, have been published for many of the common species (mainly copepods) included here and can be found at the Australian Zooplankton Taxonomic Guide and Atlas website (Richardson et al. 2013, Swadling et al. 2013).
All data have been standardised to abundance (number per m3 of water filtered) and are therefore comparable across data sets (within the constraints of mesh size and sampling procedures). The sample depth and the water depth at the sample location have been included as fields in the data file so the user can to convert to abundance per m² using whichever depth is relevant to their requirements. This will increase the usability of the data set and improve comparability between shallow and deep tows and locations. The Australian Bathymetry and Topography, June 2009 (http://www.ga.gov.au/corporate_data/67703/Rec2009_021.pdf) and ETOPO2v2 2006 (http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/relief/ETOPO2/ETOPO2v2-2006/) were used to estimate the water depth for each sample location.
We have given the average total length of adult copepods, since copepods have determinate growth, and the body size data is easily available and accepted. The juvenile size is assumed as the smallest adult size in the range given for the adult of that species. The majority of the copepod length data has been compiled from Bradford-Grieve et al. (1999) and the marine planktonic copepod website (Razouls et al. 2005-2014). Other sources were Ruth Böttger-Schnack via personal communications for Oncaeaidae and Frost and Fleminger (1968) for Clausocalanus. Size coefficients are not given for other taxa, for which the sizes are not well known and can vary greatly depending on age (not recorded in the datasets) or environmental conditions.
Surveys pertaining only to ichthyoplankton have not been included in this data set. They potentially warrant a separate database due to the volume of data available and there is already a considerable amount of data synthesis in this field.
-Data verification: Anomalous data, with uncertain species identifications, locations on land, or data with missing values have been excluded from the data set.
Exact sampling dates were not known for some projects and had to be estimated for Projects 18, 24, 29, and 615 from information given in the associated literature. The sampling date range is given in the file zooplankton_metadata.csv. The temporal resolution of the sampling is detailed in the sample_year, sample_month, sample_day and sample_time_UTC fields of the file zooplankton_metadata.csv. Exact sampling locations were not known for some of the sampling sites in Project 615. These have been inferred from figures showing the ships track and sampling locations. These data will be adequate for use in long-term time series or mapping distribution, but care will be needed if associating these values with contemporaneous environmental variables.
-Data set usage history: Some of the included data have been used in the Australian Marine Zooplankton Taxonomic Guide and Atlas to map species distributions (Richardson et al. 2013, Swadling et al. 2013) and to provide initial comparisons of tropical copepod communities (McKinnon and Duggan 2014). Large-scale analysis of these data has not yet been undertaken, but it is hoped that the publication of this data set will facilitate further analysis. Most of the projects have been analysed for the purpose for which they were collected and published. Details of these publications and the projects can be found in the file zooplankton_metadata.csv.

This dataset is a subset from the The Australian Zooplankton Database collated by Claire Davies under Project ID 9.
Dataset Methods:
This dataset contains records for Project ID 9: Planning tools for environmentally sustainable tropical finfish cage culture in Indonesia and northern Australia.	All copepods identified to species; other taxa identified to family or functional group.	The methods used to collect the data are: net type = ring; net diameter = 0.5m, net mesh size = 73microns &amp; samples are from 10 m vertical depths.
General BioTIME curators note for The Australian Zooplankton Database: please be aware that spatial sampling effort might not be consistent throughout sampling events in some projects/time-series. This can be resolved with gridding and rarefaction, however we strongly recommend against using data for study-level analyses whenever spatial effort varies largely across samples.
The Australian Zooplankton Database Metadata:
[extracted from https://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E095/278/metadata.php]
-Experimental or sampling design: Data have been collected using different equipment and sampling designs. Zooplankton have been generally collected by net, although Project 597 has used a Continuous Plankton Recorder. Nets used have varying mesh sizes and we have included these where available. Data have been sourced from research cruises, student projects, published literature and time series surveys. Details of each project are described in the file zooplankton_metadata.csv. These metadata should allow users to understand how the data compare with those from other projects when analyzing across data sets.
The taxonomic resolution for each project varies according to the aims of each specific survey. This can be especially important when using the data to interpret absences. Absences can be (a) true where the analyst did not find the target taxa, or (b) not truly representative; when the taxa were not sampled for or identified at low resolution (e.g., copepod naupliar lifestages), or the analyst did not look for the particular taxa and presence or absence was not determined. The resolution to which each data set was counted is detailed in the file zooplankton_metadata.csv. We recommend that if a taxon is not mentioned within a project then a real absence should not be interpreted. If a taxon is mentioned in some samples and not others, from within the same data set, a real absence can be inferred.
-Taxonomy and systematics: All species names have been verified in the process of uploading the data. Each species name has been updated to the current accepted scientific name according to WoRMS (World Register of Marine Species). For taxa where species identifications cannot be confirmed, a higher taxonomic level has been applied. Much of the data set also includes information on gender for copepods because species identification usually necessitates determination of gender. Taxonomic sheets, which provide species identifications and distribution maps, have been published for many of the common species (mainly copepods) included here and can be found at the Australian Zooplankton Taxonomic Guide and Atlas website (Richardson et al. 2013, Swadling et al. 2013).
All data have been standardised to abundance (number per m3 of water filtered) and are therefore comparable across data sets (within the constraints of mesh size and sampling procedures). The sample depth and the water depth at the sample location have been included as fields in the data file so the user can to convert to abundance per m² using whichever depth is relevant to their requirements. This will increase the usability of the data set and improve comparability between shallow and deep tows and locations. The Australian Bathymetry and Topography, June 2009 (http://www.ga.gov.au/corporate_data/67703/Rec2009_021.pdf) and ETOPO2v2 2006 (http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/relief/ETOPO2/ETOPO2v2-2006/) were used to estimate the water depth for each sample location.
We have given the average total length of adult copepods, since copepods have determinate growth, and the body size data is easily available and accepted. The juvenile size is assumed as the smallest adult size in the range given for the adult of that species. The majority of the copepod length data has been compiled from Bradford-Grieve et al. (1999) and the marine planktonic copepod website (Razouls et al. 2005-2014). Other sources were Ruth Böttger-Schnack via personal communications for Oncaeaidae and Frost and Fleminger (1968) for Clausocalanus. Size coefficients are not given for other taxa, for which the sizes are not well known and can vary greatly depending on age (not recorded in the datasets) or environmental conditions.
Surveys pertaining only to ichthyoplankton have not been included in this data set. They potentially warrant a separate database due to the volume of data available and there is already a considerable amount of data synthesis in this field.
-Data verification: Anomalous data, with uncertain species identifications, locations on land, or data with missing values have been excluded from the data set.
Exact sampling dates were not known for some projects and had to be estimated for Projects 18, 24, 29, and 615 from information given in the associated literature. The sampling date range is given in the file zooplankton_metadata.csv. The temporal resolution of the sampling is detailed in the sample_year, sample_month, sample_day and sample_time_UTC fields of the file zooplankton_metadata.csv. Exact sampling locations were not known for some of the sampling sites in Project 615. These have been inferred from figures showing the ships track and sampling locations. These data will be adequate for use in long-term time series or mapping distribution, but care will be needed if associating these values with contemporaneous environmental variables.
-Data set usage history: Some of the included data have been used in the Australian Marine Zooplankton Taxonomic Guide and Atlas to map species distributions (Richardson et al. 2013, Swadling et al. 2013) and to provide initial comparisons of tropical copepod communities (McKinnon and Duggan 2014). Large-scale analysis of these data has not yet been undertaken, but it is hoped that the publication of this data set will facilitate further analysis. Most of the projects have been analysed for the purpose for which they were collected and published. Details of these publications and the projects can be found in the file zooplankton_metadata.csv.",Ring nets of diameter 0.5m and mesh size 73microns,330,"Formerly study ID 330 (see curation notes 8 & 9).

In brief a fixed-route walk (transect) is established at a site and butterflies are recorded along the route on a regular (weekly) basis under reasonable weather conditions for a number of years. Transect routes are chosen to sample evenly the habitat types and management activity on sites. Care is taken in choosing a transect route as it must then remain fixed to enable butterfly sightings to be compared from year to year. Transects are typically about 2-4km long taking between 45 minutes and two hours to walk and are divided into sections corresponding to different habitat or management units.Butterflies are recorded in a fixed width band (typically 5m wide) along the transect each week from the beginning of April until the end of September yielding ideally 26 counts per year. Transect walks are undertaken between 10.45am and 3.45pm and only when weather conditions are suitable for butterfly activity: dry conditions wind speed less than Beaufort scale 5 and temperature 13?C or greater if there is at least 60% sunshine or more than 17?C if overcast. Due to the vagaries of the British and Irish weather it is rare in practice to achieve a full set of 26 weekly counts. However a small number of missing values can be estimated using other counts during the season.Single species (as opposed to normal all species) transects have been increasingly established in recent years. Whilst such transects must follow the standard methodology and must record populations at least once a week throughout the flight period the focus on a single (or small number of) species reduces both the time required to walk each transect and more significantly the number of weekly counts. With many demands on the time of site management staff and volunteer recorders this reduced method has enabled population monitoring of particular threatened butterflies to be undertaken when otherwise it would not have been possible. By regularly recording a fixed route in standardised conditions the number of butterflies seen on a transect can be compared from year to year.

Methods: Sampling is done by sweeping with canvas beating nets 38 cm in diameter. A sample of 200 sweeps (ten sets of 20 sweeps each) is taken at each site on each occasion. A sweep is taken at each step by traversing an arc of 180o with the net through the top layer of vegetation. After 20 such sweeps, the contents of the net are emptied into plastic bags. Air is squeezed out and samples are kept on ice until they can be frozen. Samples will be sorted and identified to species and instar. At this time, all 'other' insects are also kept.
All samples are taken between 1000 and 1500 hours on clear, calm warm days: cloud cover should be less than 50%, winds less than 24km/hr (15 mph), and ambient air temperature should be 25-40oC.
Sweeping effectiveness varies with site and season on Konza Prairie (e.g. sweeping is less effective on unburned prairie than on burned prairie). However, sweeping does provide good estimates of relative abundances of individual species present at any one place and time on both burned and unburned prairie. For more information, consult: Evans, E.W., R.A. Rogers, and D.J. Opfermann. 1983. Sampling grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Acrididae) on burned and unburned tall grass prairie: night trapping vs. sweeping. Environmental Entomology 12: 1449-1454.
Location of Sampling Stations:Two replicate sites per watershed. All sites are on upland (Florence) soils. In order from east to west:
Ungrazed: 002D A:grid V-26, B:U-24; 001D A:T-24, B:R-27; 0SuB A: R-27, B:Q-28; 004F A:Q-28, B:P-28; 020B A:O-28, B:N-28; 002C A:L-29, B:L-31; 0SpB A:K-29, B:J-28; 004B A:H-28,B:F-27.

Frequency of Sampling: All sites are sampled twice (approximately 1 week apart) in late July to early August.
Variable Measured: Number of individuals (categorized by instar) for individual grasshopper species.
Weather measurements are taken at each watershed before sweeps are completed. These measurements are recorded as CGR021. Time is recorded on a 24-hour scale, along with five wind speeds taken at 30 second intervals 5 feet above the ground. *Cloud coverage that is directly overhead is estimated by eye and recorded. Wind speed and temperature are collected in miles per hour and Fahrenheit using a WindMate 200 (occasionally temperature is taken from truck's thermometer). These numbers are then converted to metric units in excel when the data is being entered. For wind speed all five measurements are entered, then averaged, and finally converted to kilometers per hour. Temperatures is entered as Fahrenheit and converted to Celsius. All conversions are computed in excel using the existing formulas. The previous machine used to measure wind speed had a limit of detection of 5 mph. If the wind was blowing but could not register on the machine, then it was recorded as less than 5. However, in order to compute an average these measurements were entered as 2.5 mph. Also cloud coverage is sometimes recorded as less than 5% or as a range of percentages but when the data is entered the largest recorded number is used. (Ex. Recorded as less than 5%, Entered as 5; Recorded as 10-15%, Entered as 15)
*For the years 1983 - 2011 wind speeds were not always collected in this manner, instead measurements were taken at 5 second intervals or only one speed was recorded. However, the purpose of the weather information is to determine whether or not samples could be collected within the weather parameters as described above. Once collection has begun, and due to variable conditions on the prairie, the judgment of the research tech is employed to determine adequate collection conditions.

Summary of All Changes:
1982-1987: Sites were sampled at various earlier dates in addition to the late July-early August.
1985: Sweeping was restricted to all sites being sampled (twice, on different dates) in late July and early August. Additional watersheds (002D, 004D (now 0SpB), 004F AND 010D (now 0SuB) were added to the sampling regime for early August to provide more long-term data on the influence of fire frequency on grasshoppers. Sampling on watersheds to be grazed (N01B, N04D, and N20B) was discontinued.
1986: Watershed 004G (now 00WB) was temporarily added. Sampling in June and early July was reduced to watersheds 001D, 004D, 010D and 020B only; too few grasshoppers are collected by sweeping in the first half of the summer for all watersheds to merit sampling.
1987: Sampling in June and early July was restricted to sites 001D, 002C, 004B and 004F.
1994: Fire regime changed for 004D (became 0SpB) and 010D (became 0SuB). In the years when 0SuB is burned the sweeps are done 2 weeks earlier than normal. The summer burn is conducted on the first water appropriate day in late July to early August.
1996: Wildfire in February, burned 004F, 0SuB, 001D and 002D.
1998: 0SuB done earlier than other sites (mid-July) under the mistaken idea that the summer burns were to occur this year.
2002: Grazed (bison) transects were added in N01A, N01B, N04A, N04D, N20A and N02B. An older version of the methods manual indicates that 3 lowland (Tully) sites were once done. Locations were: 001D A: T-28; 004B A: G-28; B: S-28; B: F-28; 020B A: N-29; B: N-29
2011: WindMate 200 replaced previous machine used for checking wind speeds. The previous machine had limit of detection of 5mph. WindMate 200 specifications: Temperature -20 oC to 158 oF accuracy +1.8 oC to 89 mph accuracy +3%.
2013: Beginning with this year, Oecanthinae spp., Gryllidae spp., Tettigoniidae spp., are being added to our list. These are not new species to Konza. We are adding them to the official listing because they are related and ecologically similar.
2016: In years when SuB is burned, pre-burn and post-burn sweeps will be done. Timing for pre-burn will be mid-July and timing for post-burn will be mid-September.
2018: March 14. 004B  A was burned in a wildfire. A third sweep, C”, will be done in the vicinity of pab011 FC until 2021 when 004b is scheduled to burn per normal” schedule.

Forest inventory surveys were initiated in 1965, repeated in 1977, and repeated at 5 year intervals after that. The inventory consists of a total inventory of all trees &gt;=10 cm diameter-at-breast-height (dbh) on the whole of the watershed (13.23 ha), as measured in 208 25 m x 25 m plots (i.e. 625 sq. Meters/plot). The inventories at each year were carried out in the summer.
The data consist of the diameters (dbh) of all the trees &gt;=10 cm dbh, live and dead, in the whole of the watershed. All stems that met the size criteria were measured individually, and in some years it was noted whether a stem was part of a group of stems from the same tree (i.e. multiple stems that split from a single trunk below breast height). In 2002, uniquely numbered aluminum tags were nailed to each stem &gt;10 cm dbh to allow for tracking of individual stems from survey to survey.
Aboveground and belowground biomass was estimated for each stem in the inventory and is included in the data. Estimates were based on species-specific allometric equations developed at Hubbard Brook.",Forest inventory,NA,"The BioTIME v1 of this dataset  - study 234- underwent curation in April 2023 (see scripts: STUDY_234_AFE.R and STUDY_234_II_AFE.R). Dataset 234 in v1 was split into three studies. Below are the general curation notes (i.e. regarding all three studies) and the study-specific curation notes. New records for three new sampling periods (years 2007, 2012 and 2017) were added in 2023.
General: the data files for each year of sampling were appended, and year was added as a temporal identifier of sampling event. No data from the first year of sampling (i.e. 1965) were included because the sampling effort was different relative to the rest of the time series (i.e. in 1965 trees were monitored in subplots of 10m x 10m within each of the 208 25m x 25m, and all trees >=1.5 cm dbh were included too). In R, it was checked that tres of >=10cm dbh were included in the inventory from 1977. The records of dead trees reported for each year (vigor codes = 4, 5 & 6) were removed. Species abbreviations were converted to scientific names following the guide in  the online data portals (see references) & subsequently converted to the BioTIME species identifiers except for Betula cordifolia (not in the BT species ID list by April 2023). Codes ""ACSA3"", “PRPE2” and “PRSE2” in 2012 were identified as typos of ""ACSA”, “PRPE”, & “PRSE”, i.e. “Acer saccharum”, ""Prunus pensylvanica"" and ""Prunus serotina"". Records identified as ""UNKN"", i.e. “unknown, used for unidentifiable rotten snags” were removed. The family of each species was searched and added. As a measure of biomass, aboveground biomass was selected, but below ground biomass is also availble in the original data files (see references). The centroid of the bounding coordinates for the watershed was used as a central coordinate pair for all observations. Unique “Seq” (i.e. sequence) which is defined as “the unique number for each tree; multiple stems of same tree have same sequence” was used to count the numbers of individuals of each species per year. Study-specific: curation steps were taken to standardize differences in sample effort over the years while retaining as much data as possible. Although the data were monitored consistently in 208 plots within the watershed every year, the authors warn that prior to 1989 it is not possible to compare the data on a plot by plot basis. Therefore, for each yearly observation, we aggregated the data for the whole watershed. This allows us to keep the records for years 1977, 1982 and 1987 in the series. However, the data should be comparable on a plot by plot basis since 1989 and available in this finer spatial grain through https://hubbardbrook.org/data-catalog/ for those users who are interested. Since the data was aggregated for the whole watershed, no info on elevation was included (but this info is available in the reference links). Two observations that had dbh lower but close to the 10cm threshold were kept. Sample desc is Year since coordinates are centroids for the area.

All sampling occurs between the 3rd week of July and Labor Day. Sampling sites were chosen by random process in 1981 for the Northern lakes (Trout, Allequash, Sparkling, Crystal, and Big Muskellunge). Sites for Lake Mendota were chosen in 1981, and for the other Madison lakes (Monona, Fish, and Wingra) in 1995. All sites are identified with GPS coordinates, except on the bog lakes (Trout Bog and Crystal Bog) where nets are placed equal distances apart around the entire circumference of the lake in approximately the same locations each year.
Crayfish traps are set on all lakes except the bog lakes (Crystal Bog and Trout Bog).  Prior to 1998, five traps were set at each fyke net site. Beginning 1998, three traps are set per site. Minnow traps and crayfish traps are set in shallow water (approx 1 m), 2 traps on one side, and 1 trap on the other side of the fyke net lead. Minnow traps are baited with 1 slice of bread, and crayfish traps with 120 g of beef liver. Traps are fished for approximately 24 hours. Crayfish are identified to species. Minnows caught in either crayfish or minnow traps are identified to species, and measured for total length. Minnow traps are galvanized steel two piece traps, 44.5 cm long by 30.5 cm maximum diameter with 2.5 cm diameter openings at the ends. The mesh size is 6.4 mm on a side. Crayfish traps are identical, but the opening hole of both sides of the trap has been forced to 5 to 7 cm. Crayfish sampling was terminated for the southern lakes in 2004 after it was determined that the catch per unit effort was too low (2 crayfish caught in 500+ traps). 
Abundance is Catch per unit effort, so the total coughts have been divided by effort. This data is only referring to Crayfish catches and it's part of the North Temperate Lakes LTER sampling. For crayfish trapping, effort is given by the number of traps, so abundance as Catch Per Unit Effort is the total  yearly catch divided by the trap deployed and recollected each year.

The main site used was Shackelton Point. Because one site (Billington Bay) was only sampled some years, it is not included in the weekly average table. This table averages data taken from five sites (Shackelton Point, Buoy 109, 117 and 125, and Three Mile Bay) collected during the same sampling week. Sampling week is identified with a number that in most cases is the same as the week number of the year. On a small number of occasions, a sampling was conducted on a Friday to Sunday for the following week. The net used was a 153-um mesh nylon net (0.5 m diameter) towed vertically from approximately 1 m off the sediment surface to the water surface. The efficiency of the net was measured with flow meters from 1999 to present. If flow meter readings indicate a malfunction or human error (efficiencies below 50% and above 125%) and when no flow meter was used, we assumed an efficiency of 87.4% (average of the 1999 to 2010 sampling period 87.4% SD 9.5%, N=1655). Flow meters were calibrated each year. When flow meters were not available, volume strained was calculated as [Vol Strained] = [Tow Depth] * pi()*0.25^2*0.874. Samples were preserved in 8 % sugar-formalin solution (1964-1996) or 70 % ethyl alcohol (1997-present). Samples are stored at the Cornell Biological Field Station.
Crustacean zooplankton were counted (1964-1974) and counted and measured (1975-end of data series) using a dissecting microscope (1964-1982), a touch screen-caliper setup with computer-assisted plankton analysis system (1983-1997) (WSAM, Hambright and Fridman 1994) or a digitizing tablet and microscope (1998-end of the data series). For each sample, a 1-mL sub-sample was drawn with a calibrated Hensen-Stempel pipette or large-bore calibrated automatic pipette and all crustaceans counted and measured (since 1975). Additional sub-samples were drawn until a minimum of 100 animals were counted and measured from each sample. From 1964 to 1979, three such subsamples were counted and averaged. Gamble et al. (2006) compiled the data from 1975 to 1997 for a study on biomass size spectrum and re-measured historic samples from 1975 when only Daphnia were measured. Unrealistic length measurements sometimes substantially (for small cladocerans) outside accepted maximum lengths occurred on a small number of occasions and were assumed to be in error. They were replaced by the modal length for small cladocerans and the maximum accepted length for other species [25 of 39398 Bosmina, 146 of 28882 Chydorus, 16 of 7035 Diaphanosoma, 8 of 22767 Eubosmina, 4 of 77932 Diacyclops and 82 of 61208 nauplii] Biomass for individual species was calculated using length-weight regressions based mainly on Bottrell et al. (1976) and summarized in Watkins et al. (2011). Length-weight parameters are included in the taxa table. For years without length measurements (1964 to 1974 and 1978), the biomass is estimated from the average weight of the species or species group calculated for the time period 1975 to 1981 and given in the taxa table. Taxonomic detail varies over time. For the period 1964 to 1974 all crustacean were categorized in 10 species groups: Bosmina, Ceriodaphnia, Chydorus, Daphnia pulicaria, D. mendotae, D. retrocurva, Leptodora, Diaphanosoma, calanoid copepods and cyclopoid copepods. Nauplii were excluded in 1964-74. Information on the taxonomic details is in the taxa table. Copepod nauplii were counted since 1975 but not identified to group. Nauplii are underestimated due to the large mesh size (153µm). Rotifers and zebra mussel veligers are not included in this data set.

Lower the trap slowly so that it remains vertical in the water. Pause at the target depth long enough to allow both trap doors to close completely. and check when it reaches the surface that both did close. Drain the trap through the net and cup. swirling the cup until the liquid level is below the mesh windows. Remove the cup from the net and pull out the center pin to drain the sample into jar. then rinse cup and pin several times with 95percent EtOH into the sample jar.Sample Collection: Wisconsin NetLower the net to the bottom sample depth. Pull it up slowly. at a rate of about 3 seconds per meter. A slow haul prevents the net from pushing water and plankton away from the mouth of the net. Drain the cup until the water level is below the lower window. then pour contents into the sample jar. Rinse the cup with 95percent EtOH several times. adding the rinse to the sample jar.Hypsometric PoolingRationale and DefinitionIn March 1986 the LTER Zooplankton Group decided to pool the discrete depth Schindler Patalas trap samples into one pooled sample per lake-date for counting. Counting pooled samples rather than all of the depth samples reduces the time to produce zooplankton count data. The group hoped to count pooled samples from the entire backlog of uncounted samples and eventually to count samples shortly after collection.Samples are pooled considering lake hypsometry and. therefore. represent the entire lake. Previously. unpooled samples (2-9 samples per lake-date) or samples pooled considering only a water column were counted. Hypsometric pooling allows us to consider the zooplankton community as representing the entire lake. as our other limnological methods do. instead of just a column of water.Lake hypsometry is a three dimensional image of a lake or basin. In a simplified example of hypsometry. a lake is similar to a cone filled with water. If the cone were divided into three layers by two equidistant horizontal planes. the volumes in those layers would be very different from each other. The uppermost layer would contain the most water. Similarly. the upper depths typically contain most of the volume of a lake.Pooling is the creation of a new sample from subsamples of the Schindler trap samples collected from one lake-date. The volume of each subsample used to make the pooled sample reflects the depth range the sample represents and the volume of water that range represents relative to the entire lake volume. Samples pooled in this manner are called HP samples. for hypsometrically pooled. and are referred to as volume weighted because the volume of lake water each depth sample represents determines the subsample size.In sum. the advantages to this method of pooling are quicker turnover time and representation of the entire lake in a volume weighted fashion. Disadvantages of this method include the time required to pool subsamples. errors introduced during pooling. and the loss of more specific depth information.Pooling ProcedureAllow the sample jars to air dry for a day or two. Weigh the Wisconsin Net sample and record the weight on the Volume by Weight form. Mark the liquid level on the jar with a Sharpee brand permanent marker.Add 95percent EtOH to each Schindler trap sample to bring liquid volume up to a weight of 105g. measured by weighing the sample jar with lid on the balance. If sample jars already contain more than 105g of liquid. allow some of the volume to evaporate in the hood. and then bring up to 105g. Record the final weight of jar plus sample plus EtOH on the Volume by Weight form.Calculate the subsample volumes. called target volumes. using the hypsometric table for each lake. Record these volumes on the Volume by Weight form.Mix the first sample gently and thoroughly by tilting the jar from side to side. Measure the target volume into a plastic graduated cylinder. Pour the subsample quickly and smoothly because the plankton settle out quite rapidly. Choose the smallest size graduated cylinder that can measure the target volume in one aliquot. Add the subsample to the labeled HP jar. Repeat with all other depth samples. When all of the subsamples have been added to the HP sample. rinse each graduated cylinder into the HP jar with several small volumes of EtOH.Place the HP sample in the hood to evaporate the excess volume of EtOH. The final weight of the HP sample should be 105g. Mark the liquid level on the jar with a Sharpee brand permanent marker. If the samples are from the August quarterly. pour the remainder of each Schindler sample into a labeled jar for archival. For all other sample dates. discard what is left of the Schindler samples. Rinse and air dry the field sample jars.Sample Storage and Record KeepingStore samples in cardboard records boxes obtained from UW Stores. storing samples from each lake in a separate box. Approximately one year of samples will fit in one box. Fill out the forms for each sample and sample box. as noted below.Box Inventory Form: A record of box contents. It remains in the sample storage box.Volume by Weight Form: A record of samples collected for any one lake-date and their volumes. storage box number. and history of sample usage. Filed in 3-ring binders. one copy at the Zoology Museum and one copy with Corinna Gries.Samples Stored Form: A record of all samples collected and storage box number for each. Current forms are kept in a binder at Trout Lake; archived forms are kept in the UW Zoology Museum. The data are eventually entered into the electronic LTER Museum Catalog.When boxes become full. check the contents against the Inventory Form and Samples Stored Form. and transfer them to the sample storage room in the garage. LTER samples and related paperwork are eventually transferred to the Zoology Museum at UW-Madison.Zooplankton CountingBefore removing a subsample from any zooplankton sample jar. weigh the sample to check for evaporation. If the weight is within 0.1 gram of the last weight recorded on the Volume by Weight sheet. no fluid replacement is necessary. If the weight is more than 0.1 gram low. add 95percent EtOH to the sample to bring it up to the correct volume.Mix the sample well by turning the jar on its side and tipping back and forth gently. We use a Hensen-Stempel pipet with a 5-ml plunger for subsampling zooplankton samples. After mixing the sample. take the subsample as quickly as possible to avoid biasing the subsample as organisms begin to sink. There should be no air bubbles inside the Hensen-Stempel pipet. If there are. replace the subsample into the jar. completely dry the pipet. and begin again with the mixing. When you have a bubble-free subsample. dry the outside of the pipet and dispense the subsample into a cup with 53Âµ mesh bottom. Rinse the pipet into the cup with RO water. and continue rinsing the sample in the cup. washing the ethanol out of the sample through the mesh. Rinse the subsample into the counting tray with RO water. washing the mesh thoroughly to transfer all organisms into the tray.After removing subsample(s) from the jar. weigh the sample jar. and record this weight in a new column of the Volume by Weight form. Record the balance used. your initials. and the date at the top of the column. and add a column header such as Column C minus subsamples removed for counting . Do not put the subsample back into the sample jar after counting. Mark the new liquid level on the jar with a permanent marker. Replace the sample jar into the proper storage box.Count copepods and cladocerans first. identifying individuals to species wherever possible. and staging all copepodids. Measure a subset of each species. Then add a few drops of Lugol s solution to the subsample to stain it. and count the rotifers and nauplii. Count two subsamples for copepods and cladocerans. Count one subsample for rotifers and nauplii. If there are less than 100 of the dominant rotifer in one subsample. count a second subsample for rotifers and nauplii. Add milli-RO water to the tray as necessary to keep the surface of the subsample level. If the surface becomes concave as the subsample evaporates. it is difficult to focus clearly. and measurements may become distorted.Count all eggs attached to any species. For copepods and cladocerans. keep track of the number of individuals with eggs as well as the total number of eggs. Total number of eggs is sufficient for rotifers.Measurements are done as follows: Measure copepods from the tip of the head to the end of the urosome. excluding the caudal rami. Measure cladocerans from the tip of the head to the posterior of the carapace. excluding tailspine. However. measure helmeted Daphnia species from the anterior edge of the eye to the posterior of the carapace.Rotifers are not routinely measured. but where they have been. the total body length excluding spines is measured. Body width rather than length is measured for Conochilus. Conochiloides. and Collotheca.Describe. measure. and draw any unknown species on a separate sheet of paper. If possible. take a photograph of the unknown.All records from 1981-1989 were modified in March 2015 to correct an error in how density had been calculated. Density values in many cases are significantly reduced. Densities are contained in three database tables. The original data is in dbmaker.zoop_raw; an intermediate table is dbmaker.zoop_all_density; and the final table (the one this website extracts density from) is dbmaker.zoop_allnl_summary_snap. Density values are modified from the original to final tables as they are summed or averaged over other variables (sample depth. replicate. and sex stage). The table that was corrected in this case is dbmaker.zoop_all_density. The correction algorithm is as follows: Records from dbmaker.zoop_raw are first grouped to isolate each unique 3-tuple of lake. sample date. and species. Each group is subsequently treated independently. Multiplying the fields 'hp_factor' and 'no_per_l' results in a density value for that record. Density values are then summed within each unique replicate (sex stage is what varies within a replicate). These resultant sums are then averaged over all replicates. giving a density value for each lake. sample date. species. and depth combination. The result is written into field 'number_per_liter' in table dbmaker.zoop_all_density. Densities are subsequently summed over depth before being provided via the website.

Samples are collected as a composite whole-water sample and are preserved in gluteraldehyde. Composite sample depths are 0-8 meters for Lake Mendota (to conform to samples collected and analyzed since 1990 for a UW/DNR food web research study), and 0-2 meters for the other three lakes. A tube sampler is used for the 0-8 m Lake Mendota samples; samples for the other lakes are obtained by collecting water at 1-meter intervals using a Kemmerer water sampler and compositing the samples in a bucket. Samples are taken in the deep hole region of each lake at the same time and location as other limnological sampling. Phytoplankton samples are analyzed by a private lab specializing in phytoplankton analyses. Phytoplankton are identified to species using an inverted microscope and are reported as natural unit (i.e., colonies, filaments, or single cells) densities per mL, cell densities per mL. Multiple entries for the same species on the same date may be due to different variants or vegetative states - (e.g., colonial or attached vs. free cell.) Biovolumes for individual cells of each species are determined during the counting procedure by obtaining cell measurements needed to calculate volumes for geometric solids (e.g., cylinders, spheres, truncated cones) corresponding to actual cell shapes. Biovolume concentrations are then computed by mulitplying the average cell biovolume by the cell densities in the water sample.

The sampling strategy was designed to facilitate tests of the effect of time and shore on mobile invertebrates to species level of Echinoids, Gastropods, Asteroids (Acanthaster and Culcita only) of the fringing, backreef, and fore reef habitats of Moorea. For the purpose of this analysis, fringing communities were defined as reefs adjacent to the shore and within ca. 50 m of the land. The backreef is located within the lagoon and may be synonymous with lagoon habitats in other studies. Fore reef habitats were censused at 10 and 17-m depth in order to sample habitats that are representative of the fore reefs of Moorea, and within the depth range tractable to diving research.
The project was designed with twenty 1-m2 quadrats along a 50-m transect at each site/depth combination. To facilitate field sampling, the 50-m transect was repeated in 5 contiguous sectors that are not independent (one begins where the previous ends) and are not intended to be a factor in the statistical design. Quadrats were initially set-up randomly, but were then fixed in time. Data are collected for 4 quadrats per sector and 5 sectors per habitat.
Beginning in 2009, Acanthaster are noted when one meter away, by including the note '(1 m away)' in the species field. Beginning in 2013, Culcita are similarly noted when one meter away. And beginning in 2018, Linckia are so noted.
In 2005-2006, where none of this set of invertebrates were observed within a quadrat, the words 'No invertebrate observed' appear in the taxonomy field with a count of zero. In 2007 and later, where none of this set of invertebrates were observed within a quadrat, all species observed elsewhere on the transect are listed with a count of zero.
The year one” survey spread between 2005-2006 to cover all locations. Each subsequent year contains a complete survey.
*In 2021 fore reef 10 m and 17 m surveys were not conducted due to Covid border closures in French Polynesia.
Statistical Analysis
The original design was established to support a nested, factorial ANOVA experimental approach, but the sampling strategy is amenable to many other designs to meet the users needs. In the factorial construct, shore (north, southeast, or southwest) is treated as a fixed factor, site (LTER 1-6) as a random factor nested within shore, and time as a repeated measures factor based on individual quadrats that are relocated. In the case of the fore reef, depth (10 or 17 m) also was used as a fixed factor to contrast the effects of time and shore between depths. All census methods were designed to quantify mobile invertebrates to species level.",Abundances are estimated in 4 fixed quadrats along 5 permanent transects at each of 4 habitats at 2 sites on each of the 3 shores of Moorea each year.

Plots were setup in June 1981 with annual fertilization treatments of 10 g/m2 Nitrogen (as NH4NO3) and 5 g/m2 Phosphorous (as triple superphosphate) were applied. Greenhouses and shade houses were annually set up in late May or early June and removed in the end of August or early September. Greenhouses and shade houses were discontinued in 1989. There are 4 replicate blocks each containing 1 replicate of each of the following treatments. Control (CT)Fertilized (NP)Greenhouse (GH)SAMPLING TECHNIQUES: Biomass quadrats size 20x20 cm were taken from Toolik tussock site. Five quadrats were taken from each of four blocks. All aboveground biomass plus belowground stems and rhizomes were clipped in 20x20 cm quadrats. Normally 4 or 5 quadrats were randomly located along line transects in each of four replicate blocks for each treatment. Aboveground biomass is considered within the quadrat if it is associated with a meristem that is within the quadrat. Quadrats were sorted within 24 hours into species and then into tissue type. Depending on the harvest tissue types can be broad categories i.e. above and below or more detailed i.e. inflorescences new growth old growth etc. They were then dried at 50-70 degrees Celsius in a drying oven. After several days in the oven samples were weighed to nearest milligram. Finally the samples from all quadrats from a transect were combined according to tissue type. For some harvest samples were returned to Marine Biological Lab Woods Hole MA for nutrient analysis. Details are given in Shaver and Chapin (Ecological Monographs 61(1) 1991 pg. 1.) Leaf area was measured in 1995 and 2000 harvest with a LiCor LI-3000A area meter. Leaf areas for graminoids deciduous and forbs were measured immediately after plucking and before drying. Leaf areas for Evergreen species (except Ledum) were measured after drying for 2-4 days. Leaf areas for Ledum were measured after final dry weights were done.

Each block of plots is 96 meters on each side. Each block of plots consists of 4 experimental study plots, each occupying 1/4 of each block. The blocks of study plots are all oriented on a site in a X/Y coordinate system, with the top to the north. Each block contained one unfenced control block. The three treatments were randomly assigned to each of the four possible plots in each block independently, and their arrangements differ from block to block. Each of the three plots in a replicate block are separated by 20 meters. Each experimental measurement plot measures 36 meters by 36 meters. A permanent one-meter by one-meter vegetation measurement quadrat is located at each of the 36 points. A 3-meter wide buffer area is situated between the grid of 36 points and the perimeter of each plot. Vegetation Quadrat Measurements The foliage canopy area and maximum height of each plant species is measured from each quadrat. All cover values are measured from the vegetation measurement frame, which is 1 meter by 1 meter, and partitioned into a grid of 100, 10 cm by 10 cm squares.

Dataset methods
Continuous plankton recorder with a square aperture measuring 1.27 cm each side. The torpedo-shaped device is towed behind a ship at about 10 metres depth. Seawater and plankton enter the device through a small opening in the nose. This opening expands into a wider tunnel where the plantkon are trapped between two layers of silk and then preserved. In the laboratory, the silk layers are unrolled, cut into sections and plankton are then identified under the microscope. Formalin preserved samples identified in light microscopy.
Database methods
Sampling was done via research vessels container ships and small boats by experienced researchers students and volunteers. The majority of the samples were preserved using Lugol?s solution although formalin paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde have also been used. Different methods of preservation can affect the condition of the sample and which taxa are well preserved 417. Samples were analysed with standard methods including light microscopy transmission or scanning electron microscopy which are described in Hallegraeff et al. All methodological variations within our phytoplankton database are detailed in the metadata where available and recorded for each data entry. 
Where available a citation is referenced for each project which gives details on methodologies and limitations from that project (Table 1). There were three stages in data gathering. The first stage was to conduct a literature review of Australian phytoplankton data. Any literature that contained abundance or presence data was digitised and uploaded into the CSIRO maintained Oracle database. The second stage was to scan already existing databases such as the CSIRO data trawler the Ocean Biogeographic Ocean System (OBIS) and the Atlas of Living Australia (AOLA). These repositories only store presence records. Relevant data were selected and uploaded into the database. The third stage was to ask researchers to contribute any other data sets that they had. All data were organised into a standard format and uploaded into the database. Data were then served to and hosted by the AODN. 
Taxa methods
All taxa have been verified as accepted species and given the currently accepted name as defined by the World Register of Marine Species database (WoRMS -http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=webservice). If any taxa could not be verified then a second check was done through AlgaeBase (http://www.algaebase.org/). If this did not verify that taxa as a valid name then the taxonomic level of identification was decreased to a satisfactory level or the entry removed. All abundance values were standardised to cells.L-1 or are given as presence only. Records of the original identifications and units were archived so any records can be checked. Identification of the smaller phytoplankton is often to a coarser taxonomic level as many cannot be distinguished to species using light microscopy. In some studies electron microscopy has been used to determine species but in other studies functional groups have been identified. Cell biovolume is calculated as per Hillebrand et al. 19 following the suggested shape factors for each genera. Size parameters were estimated from measurements taken from Australian samples or Australian references where available420 and other sources where not21-23. In some data sets direct measurements of size classes (e.g. P599 the Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey and P597 the IMOS National Reference Stations) were used in preference to literature values. For some taxa there was insufficient information available to estimate a biovolume these were generally the rare taxa. Rather than estimate a size class without any information available these have been left blank. 
Data Records
Each data record represents the abundance or presence of a phytoplankton taxa at a certain point in space and time and has been given a unique record identification number P(project_id)_(sample_id)_(record_id). Each data record belongs to a project with each project having a unique identification number Pxxx. A project is defined as a set of data records which have been collected together usually as a cruise or study with the same sampling method and having the same person counting the samples. Metadata ascribed to a project relates to all the data records within that project. Details to identify each separate project are given in Table 1. Each sample within that project has a unique sample_id. The sample_id has not been changed from the original data set to maintain traceability. So these may be duplicated between projects but P(project_id)_(sample_id) will be a unique entity in space and time. Species abundance records within the sample are given a unique record_id.
Technical Validation
The Phytoplankton Database will provide an extensive resource for phytoplankton researchers although there are some caveats due to the variety of the sampling and analysis protocols. The various sample collection methods infer that abundances might not always be directlycomparable across projects. For example quantitative methods such as bottle sampling (e.g. Project 599) will collect all but the rarest phytoplankton and will include the whole size spectrum whereas semi-quantitative methods such as net sampling are selective and dependent on tow method mesh size and the mix of species present in the water as some species may clog the net and trap smaller species that would otherwise go through the mesh (e.g. Project 509)21. By including all data collected using different methods and including this information as meta-data researchers are able to analyse the relative abundance of each taxa within a project and compare across compatible projects. Metadata includes as much detail as is available about sampling methods and limitations and provides guidance to the users about the potential of each data set. Users should consider collection methods preservation techniques and microscopic limitations when comparing datasets. All datasets have been standardised to taxa/m3 of water except P1070 where the units are taxa per gram of substrate measured. This project collected the phytoplankton by collecting substrates and analysing parts of the substrate. It is included here as the only data set on Gambierdiscus and associated benthic dinoflagellates from Australia which are important to the studies of the ciguatera. All datasets submitted can be interpreted as confirming the presence of those species recorded. In some datasets e.g. time series it is possible also to infer absences assuming that all species are looked for on each sampling occasion. Absences have been included in the data sets where the project information available allowed us the confidence to interpret such absences correctly. The interpretation of absences from other projects is at the discretion of the user. We suggest that a project-by-project approach should be taken. If a taxa is notobserved at all in a project then the absence could be due to the taxa not being present that taxa not being of interest to the analyst or the inability to identify that taxa. Thus a real absence should not be inferred. If a taxa is observed in some samples of a project it can most likely be assumed that the microscopist could identify the taxa and that a real absence may be inferred in samples within that project where the taxa was not marked as present. Some data records were removed when there was ambiguity as to the identification of the taxa i.e. when the taxonomic traceability usually from older sources was confused or whenspelling mistakes make it unclear which one of two species was meant. Species known as freshwater species were removed as the methods used to collect data were not aimed at freshwater environments and the inclusion of the odd records of these species would not be comprehensive or meaningful. Estuarine species were captured and the records kept. Data records with positions on land with an unreal number for abundance or with impossible dates were also removed or converted to presence records.
Usage Notes
The database contains information on the functional group of the species which can aid analysis. Functional groups include diatoms dinoflagellates flagellates ciliates (including tintinnids) silicoflagellates and cyanobacteria. Once downloaded and binned as required data are suitable for use in the creation of ecological indicators. For example: ? Total diatoms dinoflagellates ? Diatom:Dinoflagellate ratio ? Total phytoplankton abundance or biomass per degree square. Abundance (cells.L-1) for the phytoplankton counts is given where it is available providing more information about the productivity of an area than presence data alone. A low cell abundance may indicate a low level or production but this may not be the case if these are large cells. The biomass data helps to show productivity of an area. The biovolume has been calculated for each cell count and when converted to biomass is available for use by modellers and to assist in interpretation of an area?s productivity. An accepted method of converting biovolume to biomass is to assume that the cell has the density of water (1 mm3 .L-1 = 1 mg.L- 1 ) 13. Another useful conversion is to carbon biomass; full methods are readily found in the literature24-26. Table 2 gives details conversions of phytoplankton size data to carbon biomass. Some of the data records are missing dates or coordinates. It was considered useful to keep these records as the presence of a taxa in a location may still be of value. The user may estimate coordinates from the location given and would then also be aware that these would not be the exact coordinates of the sample. Data can be analysed in many different ways and in many software applications (e.g. R Matlab). The list of citations referenced in Table 1 will also give users information as to how this data has been previously used from the discrete projects.

In the larger western Arctic region, there is evidence for widespread shrub expansion (Tape et al. 2006, Myers-Smith et al. 2011a, Lantz et al. 2013, Moffat et al. 2016). Qikiqtaruk is also located at the mid-Arctic latitudes where shrub vegetation has been found to be especially sensitive to climate (Myers-Smith et al. 2015a); although, the climate sensitivity of shrub radial growth has been observed to be low at this particular site (Myers-Smith et al. 2011b, 2015a). Community composition was measured in two vegetation communities (Fig. 1): the Herschel vegetation type and the Komakuk vegetation type. Community composition was assessed using point-framing methods following the ITEX protocols (Molau and Mølgaard 1996). Twelve plots of 1 m2 (six per vegetation type) were established in 1999 and resurveyed in 2004, 2009, and 20132017. A grid with 100 points at 10-cm spacing was placed over each plot at a height of approximately 50 cm. A metal pin was dropped vertically at each of the 100 grid points; all plant parts that touched the pin were recorded, noting species, plant part (leaf, stem, flower, flower stalk), and tissue status (live or dead). The maximum canopy height at each point and the height of the tall shrub species S. pulchrawere also recorded at every grid point.

Description of study site and monitoring protocol for conducting survey of small mammals: the study site used to monitor small mammal demography was located at Powdermill Biological Station, the field station of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. The site is located in southeastern Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania at an elevation of 450 m (please see web page for details on location: http://www.carnegiemnh.org/powdermill/ ). The study area occupied a northwest exposure and was bisected by a creek. Dominant canopy trees included beech (Fagus grandifolia), sugar maple (Acer saccharum ), yellow poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera ) and red oak (Quercus rubra ). The middle canopy was formed by striped maple (Acer pennsylvanicum ), spice bush (Lindera benzoin ), witch-hazel (Hamamelis virginiana ), and rhododendron (Rhododendron maximum ). Temperatures range from -31 oC (usually in January) to 36 oC (July and August). Snowfall occurs from October to March and may be heavy from December to March. Permanent snow cover normally occurs from about 2 months. Density of small mammals (numbers/ha) were estimated by direct enumeration methods on a 1 ha live trapping grid consisting of a 10 X 10 quadrat of trap stations at 10-m intervals. Trapping was conducted bimonthly from September 1979 to October 1999. Two large Sherman live-traps (7.6 X 8.9 X 30.5 cm) containing synthetic fiber nesting material and sunflower seeds as bait were located at each station. Trapping shelters were used at each station to monitor subnivean activity of mammals during winter months. Upon capture, small mammals were ear tagged or toe clipped for identification; at first capture, number, location on grid, mass, sex and reproductive status were recorded. Animals were weighed to the nearest 0.5 g using a Pesola scale and classified as adult, subadult or juvenile according to body mass and sexual maturity. Position of the testes (either abdominal or scrotal) was used to describe reproductive condition of males. Reproductive status of females was assessed by noting condition of the vulva (whether perforate or not perforate) and nipples (whether small, medium or lactating). Upon recapture during the same period, the number, location and mass was recorded and the animal released.",Density of small mammals (numbers/ha) were estimated by direct enumeration methods on a 1 ha live trapping grid consisting of a 10 X 10 quadrat of trap stations at 10-m intervals. ,NA,"The BioTIME v1 of this dataset  - study 308- underwent curation in April 2023 (see STUDY_308 _AFE.R). Below are the curation notes. The newest version of the dataset in the source portal was used to source the data:  https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/086fda03bd91ce9c2331e3a6fdd9bcd1.
Data were downloaded directy from the EDI Portal with the R code provided. Data for Day, Month & Year were obtained from “Date”. An observation with all temporal grain columns == NA was removed. A typo in sampling period was corrected (year 1995, month January and day 26) from 335 to 235. It was checked that a period occurred only in a year, or at the begining and end of two consecutive years. Typos in the year of sampling found for a few observations in a few periods were corrected. Observations with no animal ID or species name were removed. Data from period 0 (i.e., 2 records with a date posterior to period 1) were removed. Steps were taken to avoid including recaptures of the same individual during the same sampling period. First, individual IDs were checked, and all those which were “NONE”, blanks or special characters such as `, ? etc were standardized to blank (“”). Those observations that only contained ID but no species name (41 observations all in years 1979 & 1980) were checked case by case, re-classified into a species when possible (i.e. if they very likely belonged to one species according to immediately anterior or posterior observations) or removed when re-classification into species was not possible. A few observations of animals larger than 300g were checked, kept and updated to weight==0 only when weight data from other recaptures of the same individual or species and max species sizes reported in the internet indicated these values were likely typos (i.e. when the max size for the species reported online was much smaller than the record). After these first curation steps, an identifier concatenating ID, SPECIES and PERIOD was created. Data with this same ID concat was flagged as duplicate (i.e., a recapture) except in the cases when ID was = “”, because recaptures of the same animal could not be identified reliably if there was no ID. Then, data were split and recaptures were eliminated with the aim of preserving as much weight data records as possible. Therefore, when there were recaptures of the same individual within a period but these had all weight = 0, only the first observation of the individual in that period was kept. When there were recaptures in a period and individuals had reported weights of 0 or > 0, only one observation(i.e., capture) was kept, but the weight of the individual was the average of all observed weights for >0 for that individual for that period of sampling. Single captures were all kept regardless of the weight reported for the individual. Then because each dataset row ==1 ind, a column of abundance == 1 was added to the dataset. Species name abbreviations were converted to scientific species names following the study taxa guide. Four abbreviations (74 observations in total) had no assigned latin name and were removed. The coordinates for all records were set as the central lat & long provided in the online data source and checked to be placed where supposed. Finally, data were aggregated by species (i.e. pooling individual IDs and SEX) and by quadrant (i.e. position in the grid) within the overall sampled area (1ha) yielding one observation of abundance and biomass per species, per time period in the whole sampled area. Data were aggregated by species and sampling event. SampleDescription (i.e, sampling event) is Period. The first month of sampling within each period was kept in the column “Month” but day info was removed since data were aggregated by period.

Many zooplankton feed on phytoplankton and thus provide a link between primary producers and higher trophic levels. Zooplankton density and biovolume were determined at grid stations on the annual LTER cruises along the western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). Typically, zooplankton were collected with a 2x2 meter, 700um mesh net fitted with a flow meter and towed obliquely to 120m. Zooplankton distributions vary spatially due to water column characteristics, which affect their predators' distributions. As climate change continues to affect the WAP, the relative abundance of the various zooplankton components can also be expected to change.""

To reflect the emerging beetle fauna of surrounding dead wood, flight-interception traps were used. Traps were established throughout windthrow centres and surrounding salvage-logged areas: 22 in logged areas and 22 in non-logged areas in spring 2008. Traps in logged areas were surrounded by at least a 50 m radius of completely salvage-logged windthrows (all trees removed); traps in non-logged areas were surrounded by at least a 50 m radius of completely non-logged windthrow (all trees of the previous stand were wind felled). Each trap consisted of a crossed pair of transparent plastic shields (40660 cm) and contained a 3.0% copper-vitriol solution to preserve trapped specimens. The shortest distance between two traps was 50 m, and the largest distance between traps was 6,500 m.

This study was formerly part of study 367, which was split as part of the database v2 revision. Dataset description: This is a survey conducted on tidal flats as part of the 1000 Monitoring Sites Coastal Zone Survey. A total of eight survey sites have been set up across the country, with annual surveys conducted continuously every fiscal year and five-yearly surveys conducted once every five years. 2. Annual survey description: Two to three survey areas are set up at eight survey sites across the country. In each area, square frames (five locations) are set up at two to three survey points, and a quantitative biosurvey (2mm sieve) is conducted to record the benthos that appear within the square frames (benthos: epifauna, infauna 2mm or larger). In addition, a qualitative biosurvey is conducted to record the benthos that appear around each survey point. 3. Annual Survey Overview: Since the 2008 fiscal year, surveys have been conducted once a year; The survey period is generally set between April and June; In the 2008 fiscal year, trials were conducted at the Akkeshi, Matsukawaura, Banzu tidal flat, Nanki Tanabe, Nakatsu tidal flat, Nagura tidal flat, and Ishigaki Kawahira Bay sites; The Shio River tidal flat survey began in the 2009 fiscal year; As of the 2021 fiscal year, there are 8 sites for the tidal flat survey; Both quantitative and qualitative surveys are conducted; Each site is divided into 1 to 3 areas (A, B, C), and within each area, 2 to 3 survey points are set (upper intertidal zone: U, middle intertidal zone: M, lower intertidal zone: L); At each site, a quantitative survey is conducted to observe changes in biomass, and a qualitative survey is conducted to assess the diversity of species within the site. 4. Number of Benthos Individuals Appearing within the Square Frame and Associated Data (Biological Quantitative Survey (2mm sieve)). At each survey point, five 50 cm square frames are randomly placed to record the epibenthic animals. Then, a 15 cm diameter core sampler (to a depth of 20 cm) is used to collect the organisms along with the sediment. The extracted organisms are then passed through a 2 mm sieve, and the infaunal species are recorded. Epibenthic animals are recorded as the number of individuals appearing within 0.25 m² (50 cm square frame), while infaunal animals are recorded as the number of individuals appearing within 0.0177 m² (15 cm diameter core). Unit of abundance = IndCountInt, Unit of biomass = NA.

Despite some changes in field protocols and sampling site locations over time, the ASPE database offers a unique set of 47,869 georeferenced and standardised sampling surveys. Fish individuals are identified to species, measured and weighted.” Though preferentially focused on fishes, the surveys also report crayfish data.” [Extracted from the abstract of Irz et al., 2022]
The field sampling protocols have evolved throughout years due to (1) shifts in the objectives pursued, (2) scientific improvement of sampling techniques, (3) attempts to standardise sampling at national and European scales to gain comparability and (4) sampling increase of large river systems (Fig. 3).
Long-term network monitoring of fish assemblages requires standardised methods that provide comparable quality data. All the surveys reported here were carried out by electrofishing following standardised procedures. Two kinds of survey are reported in the database: (1) species-specific surveys (the abundance indexes”, see Fig. 3) that should not be used for the interpretation of other taxa (a taxon not reported does not indicate its absence); (2) multi-species inventories. Among multi-species inventories, complete sampling was performed for small wadable streams with one (single-pass), two, or occasionally three or more passes (multi-pass, see Belliard et al., 2012). For deeper and/or wider streams, several methods have been used, using boats when required; i.e. banks continuous sampling (Belliard et al., 2012), banks stratified habitat sampling (Pouilly, 1994) and systematic point sampling (75 or 100 spots sampled, respectively, for medium and large rivers, see Tomanova et al., 2013).
The length of the sampling point is set to include at least one riffle/pool sequence or two meanders, i.e. length exceeding 12 to 15 times the mean wetted width (variables odp_longueur” and odp_largeur_lame_eau”, respectively, in the Table operation_description_peche”). As required by the European Norm CEN-EN-14011 on sampling of fish with electricity, and to minimise the gaps between the threshold values proposed, the minimal length of sampling point was set after Belliard et al. (2012), (Table 2).
The Table operation_description_peche” documents the conditions of the surveys including the gear type and tuning, along with measures of water conductivity and temperature. Over 90% of the surveys were carried out with direct current.
The elementary sample” (table prelevement_elementaire”) is the finest grain of sound faunistic list entered in the database. Depending on the protocol implemented in the field, it pools together the catches from a set of fish batches and individuals according to different rules: (1) In complete single-pass sampling or in banks continuous sampling, the elementary sample is the whole catch for the survey. (2) In complete multi-pass sampling, the elementary sample gathers the catch for a pass. (3) In banks sampling stratified by habitat, it gathers all the catches in a given habitat strata (e.g. the riffle habitats). (4) In systematic point sampling, a compulsory elementary sample gathers the catches on the 75 (or 100) spots of the design, and an optional elementary sample gathers the catches on the so-called supplementary points” that are not included in the base protocol, but that field operators may find useful to sample because of their fine-scale originality (e.g. tributary outlet, fallen tree).” [This text corresponds to section 3.1 Electrofishing protocols, extracted from Irz et al., 2022] 
Additional: The original dataset was split into 12 datasets each with a unique consistent methodology. In each resulting dataset, the survey methods and survey strategy are consistent across sites. The same site might appear across resulting datasets if the location was monitored with different methodologies. Grain size is the average area sampled across the sites in each resulting dataset (in m2).

The values of area sampled (ope_surface_calculee) for each operation were checked. All taxa records for a given operation had the same value of area sampled assigned. When operations had an area sampled=0 or NA, records were removed due to the impossibility of calculating densities. After this step, a few sampling points monitored with the same methodology only 1 year were further removed. Tables containing taxa abundances and biomasses were added. There were no NAs or 0s in the number of individuals sampled. Thus, number of individuals were aggregated per sampling point, sampling operation and taxon and divided by surface area x 100 to obtain density of individuals /100m2. When biomass (weight in g) data were available for all individuals of a taxon sampled in one sampling point and operation, these values were included. These data were also divided by surface area x 100m2 to standardise the “Abundance” and “Biomass” variables to the same scale. There were approx. 40% of sampling surveys (i.e., operations, ope_id) for which biomasses were not available (NA or 0). In these cases, Biomass is always NA. Taxonomic nomenclature was standardised to the BioTIME guideline: “sp.” and “spp” to “sp”, “Alosa fallax rhodanensis” to “Alosa fallax”, ""Carassius auratus auratus"" to “Carassius auratus”, “Salmo trutta lacustris” to “Salmo trutta”, ""Hybride brème-gardon"" to ""Cyprinidae sp1” and ""Petromyzontidae (famille)"" to ""Petromyzontidae”. We corrected “Atherinapresbyter” to “Atherina presbyter” and updated “Gymnocephalus cernuus” to “""Gymnocephalus cernua"" and ""Leuciscus cephalus"" to ""Squalius cephalus"". We populated the BioTIME family column with the records containing Family classifications (""Astacidea"", ""Cyprinidae"", ""Mugilidae"", ""Petromyzontidae"", ""Salmonidae""). The difference in area sampled for one sampling point across time was checked (the maximum value was 0.26 km2). SampleDescription (i.e., sampling event) is: pop.id(Sampling point)_ope.id(Operation/Survey id) where pop.id contains the geographic and ope_id contains the temporal info of the sampling event. Each time series in the dataset had one of 12 unique electrofishing methodologies associated (i.e., concatenation of pro.libelle & mop.libelle, see curation script) and thus the final dataset was split into 12 studies. The methods associated are indicated in “summary methodology”, and the fields grain size, survey area, centLat and centLog contain unique information for each of the 12 studies.

At each island and mainland site, bats were sampled in a standardized manner with mist nets (6 · 2.5 m, 70/2 denier, 16-mm mesh size, five shelves) set along the perimeter of plots of c. 0.5 ha (typically 100 · 50 m; one plot per site). Each site was sampled for 7–8 complete nights over the 2-year period, with a minimum time interval of 30 days between netting nights. All sites were sampled with equal effort during all moon phases, and we generally avoided netting immediately before and after a full moon in order to minimize potential bias in capture success as a result of lunar-phobic behaviour (e.g. Morrison, 1978). During each survey night, we used six nets
erected at ground level and spaced c. 50 m apart. In order also to sample bats flying in higher forest strata, we set up a net wall, typically consisting of four stacked nets, reaching subcanopy
(mainland sites) or canopy (islands) level. Canopy height across study sites averaged < 20 m and was often < 15 m on islands. Species were identified, and standard measurements and demographic data were collected following Handley et al. (1991). Nomenclature follows Simmons (2005). Most bats (species > 10 g, excluding juveniles) were marked with individually numbered ball-chain necklaces, or, in the case of larger gleaning animalivores, with passive, subcutaneous transponders (EURO-ID, Weilerswist, Germany). Based on the classification system used by several
authors (Stevens & Willig, 2000; Patterson et al., 2003; Giannini & Kalko, 2004, 2005), we assigned bats to one of the following ensembles (Fauth et al., 1996): frugivores, gleaning
animalivores, nectarivores, omnivores, and sanguivores. For further detail please see associated papers as cited.",Mist-nets,NA,"Abundance calculated as bats/effort as per associated paper.
