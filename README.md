Abstract:

The biodiversity of an ecosystem is a key indicator of its health and
resilience. In this study, plants in tropical and subtropical moist
broad leaf forests biomes were analyzed for their total abundance across
14 locations, using publicly available data from the BioTIME database.
The analysis was then focused on one site, Barro Colorado Island located
in Panama, where the abundance and species diversity was compared over
time, from 1982 to 2015. Year to year turnover was assesed using
Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, and species evenness was assessed using the
Shannon Diveristy Index. It was found that BioTIME's dataset includes
sites from seven different countries located in Asia, North America, and
South America, with the highest total abundance recorded in Malaysia and
Panama. At the Barro Colorado site, both total abundance and species
diversity significantly decreased over time, whereas community
dissimilarity and Shannon diversity did not significantly change over
time. These findings suggest that there are potential environmental or
human factors influencing the biodiversity of this study site, through
decreased abundance and diversity, but the remaining community has
remained stable.
